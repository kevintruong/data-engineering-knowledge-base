### Amazon Workspaces

Amazon WorkSpaces is a managed desktop computing service running on the AWS cloud.

WorkSpaces allows customers to easily provision cloud-based desktops that allow end-users to
access documents and applications.

Supported client-side devices include Windows and Mac computers, Chromebooks, iPads, Fire tablets, Android tablets, and Chrome and Firefox web browsers.

WorkSpaces offers bundles that come with a Windows 7 or Windows 10 desktop experience,
powered by Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2016 respectively.

By default, users can personalize their workspaces, but this can be locked down.

By default, you will be given local administrator access.

Workspaces are persistent.

The user volume (D:) on the WorkSpace is backed up every 12 hours.

You do not need an AWS account to login to workspaces.
