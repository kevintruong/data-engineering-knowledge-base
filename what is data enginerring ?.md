## what is data engineering 

Data engineering is all about movement , manupultion and management of data 

Data engieering is a set of operating amimed at creating interfaces and mechanism s for the flow and access of information. It takes delicated specialists - data engineers - to maintain data so that it remainds available and usable by others. In short, data engineers setup and operate the organization's data infrastructure, preparing it for further analysts and scientists  

### data engineering defined 

- Data engineering is the development, implementation and maintance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce hight-quality, consistent information that support downstream use cases, such as analysis and machinelearning.
- Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, Dataops,data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. 
- A data engineer manages the data engieering lifecycle, begining with getting data from source system and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analyss or machine learning
