### EC2 RI Types:

EC2 has three **Reserved Instance** types: Standard, Convertible, and Scheduled.
- Standard = commitment of 1 or 3 years, charged whether itâ€™s on or off.
- Scheduled = reserved for specific periods of time, accrue charges hourly, billed in monthly increments over the term (1 year).
- Scheduled RIs match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule.
