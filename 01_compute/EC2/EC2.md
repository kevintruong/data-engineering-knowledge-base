## EC2

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. #card
  
  It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
  
  With Amazon EC2 you launch virtual server instances on the AWS cloud.
  
  Each virtual server is known as an “instance”.
- You are limited to running up to a total of 20 On-Demand instances across the instance family,
- purchasing 20 Reserved Instances
- requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic spot limit per region (by default).
- AWS are transitioning to a vCPU based, rather than instance based, limit. 
  
  This is currently being rolled out and may not feature on the exam yet.
  
  Amazon EC2 currently supports a variety of operating systems including:
  Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, Gentoo Linux, Oracle Linux, and FreeBSD.
  
  EC2 compute units (ECU) provide the ||relative measure|| of the integer processing power of an Amazon EC2 instance.
  
  With EC2 you have full control at the operating system layer.
