### **EC2 Key pair**

<!-- #ec2_keypair -->


**Key pairs are used to securely connect to EC2 instances:**
- A key pair consists of a **public key** that AWS stores, and a **private key file** that you store.
- For Windows AMIs, the private key file is required to obtain the password used to log into your instance.
- For Linux AMIs, the private key file allows you to securely SSH (secure shell) into your instance.
