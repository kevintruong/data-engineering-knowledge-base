## MANAGEMENT TOOLS

### Amazon CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS.

CloudWatch vs CloudTrail:

Used to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms.

Automatically react to changes in your AWS resources.

**With CloudWatch you can monitor resources such as:**

- EC2 instances.
- DynamoDB tables.
- RDS DB instances.
- Custom metrics generated by applications and services.
- Any log files generated by your applications.

Gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization.

Monitor application performance.

Monitor operational health.

CloudWatch is accessed via API, command-line interface, AWS SDKs, and the AWS Management Console.

CloudWatch integrates with IAM.

**CloudWatch Logs:**

- Amazon CloudWatch Logs lets you monitor and troubleshoot your systems and applications using your existing system, application and custom log files.
- You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources.
- CloudWatch Logs can be used for real time application and system monitoring as well as long term log retention.
- CloudWatch Logs keeps logs indefinitely by default.
- CloudTrail logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring.
- CloudWatch Logs metric filters can evaluate CloudTrail logs for specific terms, phrases or values.

**CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:**

- Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution custom metrics.
- Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1 minute) are available for 15 days.
- Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5 minute) are available for 63 days.
- Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).

### AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records activity made on your account

A CloudTrail trail can be created which delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.

CloudWatch vs CloudTrail:

CloudTrail is about logging and saves a history of API calls for your AWS account.

Provides visibility into user activity by recording actions taken on your account.

API history enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing.

**Logs API calls made via:**

- AWS Management Console.
- AWS SDKs.
- Command line tools.
- Higher-level AWS services (such as CloudFormation).

**CloudTrail records account activity and service events from most AWS services and logs the following records:**

- The identity of the API caller.
- The time of the API call.
- The source IP address of the API caller.
- The request parameters.
- The response elements returned by the AWS service.

CloudTrail is per AWS account.

Trails can be enabled per region or a trail can be applied to all regions.

**Trails can be configured to log data events and management events:**

- **Data events:** These events provide insight into the resource operations performed on or within a resource. These are also known as data plane operations.
- **Management events:** Management events provide insight into management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as control plane operations. Management events can also include non-API events that occur in your account.

CloudTrail log files are encrypted using S3 Server Side Encryption (SSE).

You can also enable encryption using SSE KMS for additional security.

A single KMS key can be used to encrypt log files for trails applied to all regions.

**You can consolidate logs from multiple accounts using an S3 bucket:**

1. Turn on CloudTrail in the paying account.
2. Create a bucket policy that allows cross-account access.
3. Turn on CloudTrail in the other accounts and use the bucket in the paying account.  You can integrate CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs to deliver data events captured by CloudTrail to a CloudWatch Logs log stream.

CloudTrail log file integrity validation feature allows you to determine whether a CloudTrail log file was unchanged, deleted, or modified since CloudTrail delivered it to the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

### AWS OpsWorks

AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet two very popular automation platforms.

Automates how applications are configured, deployed and managed.

Provide configuration management to deploy code, automate tasks, configure instances, perform upgrades etc.

OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed, and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises compute environments.

OpsWorks is an automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code.

**OpsWorks consists of Stacks and Layers:**

- Stack are collections of resources needed to support a service or application.
- Stacks are containers of resources (EC2, RDS etc.) that you want to manage collectively.
- Every Stack contains one or more Layers and Layers automate the deployment of packages.
- Stacks can be cloned – but only within the same region.
- Layers represent different components of the application delivery hierarchy.
- EC2 instances, RDS instances, and ELBS are examples of Layers.

OpsWorks is a global service. But when you create a stack, you must specify a region and that stack can only control resources in that region.

There are three offerings: OpsWorks for Chef Automate, OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise, and OpsWorks Stacks.

**AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate**

- A fully-managed configuration management service that hosts Chef Automate, a suite of automation tools from Chef for configuration management, compliance and security, and continuous deployment.
- Completely compatible with tooling and cookbooks from the Chef community and automatically registers new nodes with your Chef server.
- Chef server stores recipes and configuration data.
- Chef client (node) is installed on each server.

**AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise**

- A fully-managed configuration management service that hosts Puppet Enterprise, a set of automation tools from Puppet for infrastructure and application management.

**AWS OpsWorks Stacks**

- An application and server management service that allows you to model your application as a stack containing different layers, such as load balancing, database, and application server.
- OpsWorks Stacks is an AWS creation and uses and embedded Chef Solo client installed on EC2 instances to run Chef recipes.

OpsWorks Stacks supports EC2 instances and on-premise servers as well as an agent.

### AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment.

CloudFormation can be used to provision a broad range of AWS resources.

Think of CloudFormation as deploying infrastructure as code.

Elastic Beanstalk is more focused on deploying applications on EC2 (PaaS).

CloudFormation can deploy Elastic Beanstalk-hosted applications however the reverse is not possible.

Logical IDs are used to reference resources within the template.
Physical IDs identify resources outside of AWS CloudFormation templates, but only after the resources have been created.

Concept of templates, stacks and change sets:

**Templates:**

- Architectural designs
- Create, update and delete templates
- Written in JSON or YAML
- CloudFormation determines the order of provisioning
- Don’t need to worry about dependencies
- Modifies and updates templates in a controlled way (version control)
- Designer allows you to visualize using a drag and drop interface

**Stacks:**

- Deployed resources based on templates
- Create, update and delete stacks using templates
- Deployed through the Management Console, CLI or APIs

**Template elements**

Mandatory:

- File format and version
- List of resources and associated configuration values

**Not mandatory:**

- Template parameters (limited to 60)
- Output values (limited to 60)
- List of data tables

Puppet and Chef integration is supported.

Can use bootstrap scripts.

Can define deletion policies.

Provides WaitCondition function.

Can create roles in IAM.

VPCs can be created and customized.

VPC peering in the same AWS account can be performed.

Route 53 is supported.

**Stack creation errors:**

- Automatic rollback on error is enabled by default.
- You will be charged for resources provisioned even if there is an error.

**Updating stacks:**

- AWS CloudFormation provides two methods for updating stacks: direct update or creating and executing change sets.
- When you directly update a stack, you submit changes and AWS CloudFormation immediately deploys them.
- Use direct updates when you want to quickly deploy your updates.
- With change sets, you can preview the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to your stack, and then decide whether to apply those changes.

**StackSets**

- AWS CloudFormation StackSets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation.
- Using an administrator account, you define and manage an AWS CloudFormation template, and use the template as the basis for provisioning stacks into selected target accounts across specified regions.
- An administrator account is the AWS account in which you create stack sets.
- A stack set is managed by signing in to the AWS administrator account in which it was created.
- A target account is the account into which you create, update, or delete one or more stacks in your stack set.

Before you can use a stack set to create stacks in a target account, you must set up a trust relationship between the administrator and target accounts.

**Best Practices**

- AWS provides Python “helper scripts” which can help you install software and start services on your EC2 instances.
- Use CloudFormation to make changes to your landscape rather than going directly into the resources.
- Make use of Change Sets to identify potential trouble spots in your updates.
- Use Stack Policies to explicitly protect sensitive portions of your stack.
- Use a version control system such as CodeCommit or GitHub to track changes to templates.

**Charges**

- There is no additional charge for AWS CloudFormation.
- You pay for AWS resources (such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, etc.) created using AWS CloudFormation in the same manner as if you created them manually.
- You only pay for what you use, as you use it; there are no minimum fees and no required upfront commitments.

### AWS Config

**GENERAL**

AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to enable security and governance.

With AWS Config you can discover existing AWS resources, export a complete inventory of your AWS resources with all configuration details, and determine how a resource was configured at any point in time.

These capabilities enable compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.

Allow you to assess, audit and evaluate configurations of your AWS resources.

Very useful for Configuration Management as part of an ITIL program.

Creates a baseline of various configuration settings and files and can then track variations against that baseline.

**AWS CONFIG VS CLOUDTRAIL**

AWS CloudTrail records user API activity on your account and allows you to access information about this activity.

AWS Config records point-in-time configuration details for your AWS resources as Configuration Items (CIs).

You can use an AWS Config CI to answer “What did my AWS resource look like?” at a point in time.

You can use AWS CloudTrail to answer “Who made an API call to modify this resource?”.

**CONFIG RULES**

A Config Rule represents desired configurations for a resource and is evaluated against configuration changes on the relevant resources, as recorded by AWS Config.

AWS Config Rules can check resources for certain desired conditions and if violations are found the resources are flagged as “noncompliant”.

**Examples of Config Rules:**

- Is backup enabled on RDS?
- Is CloudTrail enabled on the AWS account?
- Are EBS volumes encrypted.

**CONFIGURATION ITEMS**

A Configuration Item (CI) is the configuration of a resource at a given point-in-time. A CI consists of 5 sections:

1. Basic information about the resource that is common across different resource types (e.g., Amazon Resource Names, tags).
2. Configuration data specific to the resource (e.g., EC2 instance type).
3. Map of relationships with other resources (e.g., EC2::Volume vol-3434df43 is “attached to instance” EC2 Instance i-3432ee3a).
4. AWS CloudTrail event IDs that are related to this state.
5. Metadata that helps you identify information about the CI, such as the version of this CI, and when this CI was captured.

**CHARGES**

With AWS Config, you are charged based on the number configuration items (CIs) recorded for supported resources in your AWS account.

AWS Config creates a configuration item whenever it detects a change to a resource type that it is recording.

### AWS Systems Manager

AWS Systems Manager allows you to centralize operational data from multiple AWS services and automate tasks across your AWS resources.

You can create logical groups of resources such as applications, different layers of an application stack, or production versus development environments.

With Systems Manager, you can select a resource group and view its recent API activity, resource configuration changes, related notifications, operational alerts, software inventory, and patch compliance status.

You can also take action on each resource group depending on your operational needs.  Systems Manager provides a central place to view and manage your AWS resources, so you can have complete visibility and control over your operations.

Centralized console and toolset for a wide variety of system management tasks.

Designed for managing a large fleet of systems – tens or hundreds.


SSM Agent enables System Manager features and supports all OSs supported by OS as well as back to Windows Server 2003 and Raspbian.

SSM Agent installed by default on recent AWS-provided base AMIs for Linux and Windows.

Manages AWS-based and on-premises based systems via the agent.

The AWS Systems Manager console integrates with AWS Resource Groups, and it offers grouping capabilities in addition to other native integrations.

**Systems Manager Inventory:**

- AWS Systems Manager collects information about your instances and the software installed on them, helping you to understand your system configurations and installed applications.
- You can collect data about applications, files, network configurations, Windows services, registries, server roles, updates, and any other system properties.
- The gathered data enables you to manage application assets, track licenses, monitor file integrity, discover applications not installed by a traditional installer, and more.

**Configuration Compliance:**

- AWS Systems Manager lets you scan your managed instances for patch compliance and configuration inconsistencies.
- You can collect and aggregate data from multiple AWS accounts and Regions, and then drill down into specific resources that aren’t compliant.
- By default, AWS Systems Manager displays data about patching and associations. You can also customize the service and create your own compliance types based on your requirements.

**Automation:**

- AWS Systems Manager allows you to safely automate common and repetitive IT operations and management tasks across AWS resources.
- With Systems Manager, you can create JSON documents that specify a specific list of tasks or use community published documents.
- These documents can be executed directly through the AWS Management Console, CLIs, and SDKs, scheduled in a maintenance window, or triggered based on changes to AWS resources through Amazon CloudWatch Events.
- You can track the execution of each step in the documents as well as require approvals for each step.
- You can also incrementally roll out changes and automatically halt when errors occur.

**Run Command:**

- Use Systems Manager Run Command to remotely and securely manage the configuration of
    your managed instances at scale. Use Run Command to perform on-demand changes like
    updating applications or running Linux shell scripts and Windows PowerShell commands on
    a target set of dozens or hundreds of instances.

**Session Manager:**

- AWS Systems Manager provides you safe, secure remote management of your instances at scale without logging into your servers, replacing the need for bastion hosts, SSH, or remote PowerShell.
- It provides a simple way of automating common administrative tasks across groups of instances such as registry edits, user management, and software and patch installations.
- Through integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can apply granular permissions to control the actions users can perform on instances.
- All actions taken with Systems Manager are recorded by AWS CloudTrail, allowing you to audit changes throughout your environment.

**Patch Manager:**

- AWS Systems Manager helps you select and deploy operating system and software patches automatically across large groups of Amazon EC2 or on-premises instances.
- Through patch baselines, you can set rules to auto-approve select categories of patches to be installed, such as operating system or high severity patches, and you can specify a list of patches that override these rules and are automatically approved or rejected.
- You can also schedule maintenance windows for your patches so that they are only applied during preset times.
- Systems Manager helps ensure that your software is up-to-date and meets your compliance policies.

**Maintenance Windows:**

- AWS Systems Manager lets you schedule windows of time to run administrative and
    maintenance tasks across your instances.
- This ensures that you can select a convenient and safe time to install patches and updates or make other configuration changes, improving the availability and reliability of your services and applications.

**Distributor:**

- Distributor is an AWS Systems Manager feature that enables you to securely store and distribute software packages in your organization.
- You can use Distributor with existing Systems Manager features like Run Command and State Manager to control the lifecycle of the packages running on your instances.

**State Manager:**

- AWS Systems Manager provides configuration management, which helps you maintain consistent configuration of your Amazon EC2 or on-premises instances.
- With Systems Manager, you can control configuration details such as server configurations, anti-virus definitions, firewall settings, and more.
- You can define configuration policies for your servers through the AWS Management Console or use existing scripts, PowerShell modules, or Ansible playbooks directly from GitHub or Amazon S3 buckets.
- Systems Manager automatically applies your configurations across your instances at a time and frequency that you define.
- You can query Systems Manager at any time to view the status of your instance configurations, giving you on-demand visibility into your compliance status.

**Parameter Store:**

- AWS Systems Manager provides a centralized store to manage your configuration data, whether plain-text data such as database strings or secrets such as passwords.
- This allows you to separate your secrets and configuration data from your code. Parameters can be tagged and organized into hierarchies, helping you manage parameters more easily.
- For example, you can use the same parameter name, “db-string”, with a different hierarchical path, “dev/db-string” or “prod/db-string”, to store different values.
- Systems Manager is integrated with AWS Key Management Service (KMS), allowing you to automatically encrypt the data you store.
- You can also control user and resource access to parameters using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Parameters can be referenced through other AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Container Service, AWS Lambda, and AWS CloudFormation.
