#### Question  47

**A pharmaceutical company uses a strict process for release automation that involves building and testing services in 3

separate VPCs. A peering topology is configured with VPC-A peered with VPC-B and VPC-B peered with VPC-C. The

development team wants to modify the process so that they can release code directly from VPC-A to VPC-C.**

**How can this be accomplished?**

- [ ] Update VPC-Bs route table with peering targets for VPC-A and VPC-C and enable route propagation

- [x] Create a new VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-C

- [ ] Update the CIDR blocks to match to enable inter-VPC routing

- [ ] Update VPC-As route table with an entry using the VPC peering as a target
