#### Question  42

**A Solutions Architect is designing a three-tier web application that includes an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2

Instances running behind an Elastic Load Balancer. The security team requires that all web servers must be accessible

only through the Elastic Load Balancer and that none of the web servers are directly accessible from the Internet.**

**How should the Architect meet these requirements?**

- [ ] Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the Elastic Load Balancer

- [ ] Configure the web servers' security group to deny traffic from the Internet

- [x] Configure the web tier security group to allow only traffic from the Elastic Load Balancer

- [ ] Install a Load Balancer on an Amazon EC2 instance
