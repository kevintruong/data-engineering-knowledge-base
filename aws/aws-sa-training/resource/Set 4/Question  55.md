#### Question  55


**Several environments are being created in a single Amazon VPC. The Solutions Architect needs to implement a system of

categorization that allows for identification of Amazon EC2 resources by business unit, owner, or environment.**


**Which AWS feature can be used?**


1: Parameters


2: Metadata


3: Custom filters


4: Tags


**Answer: 4**


**Explanation:**


A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you

define. Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or

environment.


- CORRECT "Tags" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Parameters" is incorrect. Parameters are not used for categorization


- INCORRECT "Metadata" is incorrect. Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or

  manage the running instance.


- INCORRECT "Custom filters" is incorrect. Custom filters are not used for categorization.
