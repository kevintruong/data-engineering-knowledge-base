**What combination of services represent the BEST options support these requirements? (Select TWO)**


- [ ] Use AWS Glue to extract the data, analyze it, and load it back to the S3 bucket


- [ ] Use bucket ACLs to restrict access to the bucket


- [x] Use IAM policies to restrict access to the bucket
