**Explanation:**

Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated)

and for users who have been authenticated and received a token. An identity pool is a store of user identity data

specific to your account.

With an identity pool, users can obtain temporary AWS credentials to access AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and

DynamoDB.

* ✅ :  "Identity Pools" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "User Pools" is incorrect. A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, users can

  sign in to web or mobile apps through Amazon Cognito, or federate through a third-party identity provider (IdP).

* ❌ :  "Key Pairs" is incorrect. Key pairs are used in Amazon EC2 for access to instances.

* ❌ :  "SAML Identity Providers" is incorrect. SAML Identity Providers are supported IDPs for identity pools but

  cannot be used for gaining temporary credentials for AWS services.
