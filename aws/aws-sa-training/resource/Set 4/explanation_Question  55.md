**Explanation:**

A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you

define. Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or

environment.

* ✅ :  "Tags" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Parameters" is incorrect. Parameters are not used for categorization

* ❌ :  "Metadata" is incorrect. Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or

  manage the running instance.

* ❌ :  "Custom filters" is incorrect. Custom filters are not used for categorization.
