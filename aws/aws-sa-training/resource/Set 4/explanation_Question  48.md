**Explanation:**

AWS recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query

API to make direct calls to the IAM web service. An access key ID and secret access key must be used for authentication

when using the Query API.

* ✅ :  "Query API" is a correct answer.

* ✅ :  "Access key ID and secret access key" is also a correct answer.

* ❌ :  "OpenID Connect" is incorrect. OpenID Connect is a provider for connecting external directories.

* ❌ :  "API Gateway" is incorrect. API gateway is a separate service for accepting and processing API calls.

* ❌ :  "IAM role" is incorrect. An IAM role is not used for authentication to the Query API.
