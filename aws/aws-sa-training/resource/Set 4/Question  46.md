#### Question  46


**There is a problem with an EC2 instance that was launched by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. The EC2 status checks have

reported that the instance is “Impaired”. What action will EC2 Auto Scaling take?**


- [ ] Auto Scaling will perform Availability Zone rebalancing


- [x] It will wait a few minutes for the instance to recover and if it does not it will mark the instance for termination,

terminate it, and then launch a replacement


- [ ] Auto Scaling performs its own status checks and does not integrate with EC2 status checks


- [ ] It will launch a new instance immediately and then mark the impaired one for replacement
