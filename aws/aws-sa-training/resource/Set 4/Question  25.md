#### Question  25


**One of the applications you manage on RDS uses the MySQL DB and has been suffering from performance issues. You would

like to setup a reporting process that will perform queries on the database but youâ€™re concerned that the extra load

will further impact the performance of the DB and may lead to poor customer experience.**


**What would be the best course of action to take so you can implement the reporting process?**


1: Configure Multi-AZ to setup a secondary database instance in another region


2: Deploy a Read Replica to setup a secondary read-only database instance


3: Deploy a Read Replica to setup a secondary read and write database instance


4: Configure Multi-AZ to setup a secondary database instance in another Availability Zone


**Answer: 2**


**Explanation:**


The reporting process will perform queries on the database but not writes. Therefore you can use a read replica which

will provide a secondary read-only database and configure the reporting process to use the read replica.


Multi-AZ is used for implementing fault tolerance. With Multi-AZ you can failover to a DB in another AZ within the

region in the event of a failure of the primary DB. However, you can only read and write to the primary DB so still need

a read replica to offload the reporting job


- CORRECT "Deploy a Read Replica to setup a secondary read-only database instance" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Configure Multi-AZ to setup a secondary database instance in another region" is incorrect as described

  above.


- INCORRECT "Deploy a Read Replica to setup a secondary read and write database instance" is incorrect. Read replicas

  are for workload offloading only and do not provide the ability to write to the database.


- INCORRECT "Configure Multi-AZ to setup a secondary database instance in another Availability Zone" is incorrect as

  described above.
