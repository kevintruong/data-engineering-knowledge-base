#### Question  35


**One of the departments in a company has been generating a large amount of data on Amazon S3 and costs are increasing.

Data older than 90 days is rarely accessed but must be retained for several years. If this data does need to be accessed

at least 24 hours notice is provided.**


**How can a Solutions Architect optimize the costs associated with storage of this data whilst ensuring it is accessible

if required?**


- [ ] Implement archival software that automatically moves the data to tape


- [ ] Use S3 lifecycle policies to move data to the STANDARD_IA storage class


- [x] Use S3 lifecycle policies to move data to GLACIER after 90 days
