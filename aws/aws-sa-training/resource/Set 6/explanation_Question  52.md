**Explanation:**

EBS Throughput Optimized HDD is good for the following use cases (and is the most cost-effective option:

* Frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads with large datasets and large I/O sizes, such as MapReduce, Kafka,

  log processing, data warehouse, and ETL workloads

Throughput is measured in MB/s, and includes the ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, with a baseline throughput of

40 MB/s per TB and a maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume.

* ✅ :  "EBS Throughput Optimized HDD" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "EBS General Purpose SSD in a RAID 1 configuration" is incorrect. This is not the best solution for the

  requirements or the most cost-effective.

* ❌ :  "EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD" is incorrect. SSD disks are more expensive.

* ❌ :  "EBS General Purpose SSD" is incorrect. SSD disks are more expensive.
