**Explanation:**

The cold HDD (sc1) EBS volume type is the lowest cost option that is suitable for this use case. The sc1 volume type is

suitable for infrequently accessed data and use cases that are oriented towards throughput like sequential data access.

- ✅ :  "Cold HDD (sc1)" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)" is incorrect. This is the most expensive option and used for use cases that

  demand high IOPS.

- ❌ :  "General Purpose SSD (gp2)" is incorrect. This is a more expensive SSD volume type that is used for general

  use cases.

- ❌ :  "Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)" is incorrect. This is also used for throughput-oriented use cases however

  it is higher cost than sc1 and better for frequently accessed data.
