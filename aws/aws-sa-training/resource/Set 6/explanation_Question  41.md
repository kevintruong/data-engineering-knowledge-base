_Instance metadata_ is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. Instance

metadata is divided into categories, for example, host name, events, and security groups.

Instance metadata is available at [http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data.](http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data.)
