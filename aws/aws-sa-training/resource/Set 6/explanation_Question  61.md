**Explanation:**

Zonal redundancy indicates that the architecture should be split across multiple Availability Zones. Subnets are mapped

1:1 to AZs.

A public subnet should be used for the Internet-facing web servers and a separate private subnet should be used for the

internal-only DB servers. Therefore, you need 4 subnets – 2 (for redundancy) per public/private subnet.

* ✅ :  "4 subnets" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "2 subnets" is incorrect as explained above.

* ❌ :  "6 subnets" is incorrect as explained above.

* ❌ :  "2 subnet" is incorrect as explained above.
