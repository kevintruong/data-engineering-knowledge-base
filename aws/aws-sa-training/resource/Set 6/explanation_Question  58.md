**Explanation:**

The following scaling policy options are available:

**Simple** – maintains a current number of instances, you can manually change the ASGs min/desired/max and attach/detach

instances.

**Scheduled** – Used for predictable load changes, can be a single event or a recurring schedule

**Dynamic** (event based) – scale in response to an event/alarm.

Step – configure multiple scaling steps in response to multiple alarms.
