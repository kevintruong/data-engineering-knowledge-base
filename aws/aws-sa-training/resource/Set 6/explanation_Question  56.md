**Explanation:**

Connection draining is enabled by default and provides a period of time for existing connections to close cleanly. When

connection draining is in action an CLB will be in the status “InService: Instance deregistration currently in

progress”.

* ✅ :  "Connection Draining" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Sticky Sessions" is incorrect. Session stickiness uses cookies and ensures a client is bound to an

  individual back-end instance for the duration of the cookie lifetime.

* ❌ :  "Proxy Protocol" is incorrect. The Proxy Protocol header helps you identify the IP address of a client when

  you have a load balancer that uses TCP for back-end connections.

* ❌ :  "Deletion Protection" is incorrect. Deletion protection is used to protect the ELB from deletion.
