#### Question  30


**A financial services company regularly runs an analysis of the dayâ€™s transaction costs, execution reporting, and

market performance. The company currently uses third-party commercial software for provisioning, managing, monitoring,

and scaling the computing jobs which utilize a large fleet of EC2 instances.**


**The company is seeking to reduce costs and utilize AWS services. Which AWS service could be used in place of the

third-party software?**


1: Amazon Athena


2: AWS Systems Manager


3: Amazon Lex


4: AWS Batch


**Answer: 4**


**Explanation:**


AWS Batch eliminates the need to operate third-party commercial or open source batch processing solutions. There is no

batch software or servers to install or manage. AWS Batch manages all the infrastructure for you, avoiding the

complexities of provisioning, managing, monitoring, and scaling your batch computing jobs.


- CORRECT "AWS Batch" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Amazon Athena" is incorrect. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze

  data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.


- INCORRECT "AWS Systems Manager" is incorrect. AWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your

  infrastructure on AWS.


- INCORRECT "Amazon Lex" is incorrect. Amazon Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces into any

  application using voice and text.
