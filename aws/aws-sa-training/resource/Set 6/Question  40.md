#### Question  40


**A development team needs to run up a few lab servers on a weekend for a new project. The servers will need to run

uninterrupted for a few hours. Which EC2 pricing option would be most suitable?**


1: Spot


2: Reserved


3: On-Demand


4: Dedicated Instances


**Answer: 3**


**Explanation:**


On-Demand pricing ensures that instances will not be terminated and is the most economical option. Use on- demand for

ad-hoc requirements where you cannot tolerate interruption.


- CORRECT "On-Demand" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Spot" is incorrect. Spot pricing may be the most economical option for a short duration over a weekend but

  you may have the instances terminated by AWS and there is a requirement that the servers run uninterrupted.


- INCORRECT "Reserved" is incorrect. Reserved pricing provides a reduced cost for a contracted period (1 or 3 years),

  and is not suitable for ad hoc requirements.


- INCORRECT "Dedicated instances" is incorrect. Dedicated instances run on hardware thatâ€™s dedicated to a single

  customer and are more expensive than regular On-Demand instances.
