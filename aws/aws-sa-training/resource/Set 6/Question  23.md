#### Question  23


**A Solutions Architect is deploying a production application that will use several Amazon EC2 instances and run

constantly on an ongoing basis. The application cannot be interrupted or restarted. Which EC2 pricing model would be

best for this workload?**


1: Reserved instances


2: On-demand instances


3: Spot instances


4: Flexible instances


**Answer: 1**


**Explanation:**


In this scenario for a stable process that will run constantly on an ongoing basis RIs will be the most affordable

solution.


RIs provide you with a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand instance pricing. You have the flexibility

to change families, OS types, and tenancies while benefitting from RI pricing when you use Convertible RIs.


- CORRECT "Reserved instances" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "On-demand instances" is incorrect. On-demand is useful for short term ad-hoc requirements for which the job

  cannot afford to be interrupted and are typically more expensive than Spot instances.


- INCORRECT "Spot instances" is incorrect. Spot is more suited to short term jobs that can afford to be interrupted and

  offer the lowest price of all options.


- INCORRECT "Flexible instances" is incorrect. Thereâ€™s no such thing as flexible instances.
