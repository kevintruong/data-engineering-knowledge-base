#### Question  53

**An Amazon EBS-backed EC2 instance has been launched. A requirement has come up for some high- performance ephemeral

storage.**

**How can a Solutions Architect add a new instance store volume?**

- [ ] :  You must shutdown the instance in order to be able to add the instance store volume

- [ ] :  You must use an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) to add instance store volumes. First, attach an ENA, and then attach

the instance store volume

- [x] :  You can specify the instance store volumes for your instance only when you launch an instance

- [ ] :  You can use a block device mapping to specify additional instance store volumes when you launch your instance, or you

can attach additional instance store volumes after your instance is running
