#### Question  32

**An Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) has been created to store data that will be accessed by a large number of Amazon

EC2 instances. The data is sensitive and a Solutions Architect is creating a design for security measures to protect the

data. It is required that network traffic is restricted correctly based on firewall rules and access from hosts is

restricted by user or group.**

**How can this be achieved with Amazon EFS? (Select TWO)**

- [x] Use POSIX permissions to control access from hosts by user or group

- [ ] Use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect EFS

- [x] Use EFS Security Groups to control network traffic

- [ ] Use Network ACLs to control the traffic
