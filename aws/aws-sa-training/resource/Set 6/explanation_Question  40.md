**Explanation:**

On-Demand pricing ensures that instances will not be terminated and is the most economical option. Use on- demand for

ad-hoc requirements where you cannot tolerate interruption.

* ✅ :  "On-Demand" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Spot" is incorrect. Spot pricing may be the most economical option for a short duration over a weekend but

  you may have the instances terminated by AWS and there is a requirement that the servers run uninterrupted.

* ❌ :  "Reserved" is incorrect. Reserved pricing provides a reduced cost for a contracted period (1 or 3 years),

  and is not suitable for ad hoc requirements.

* ❌ :  "Dedicated instances" is incorrect. Dedicated instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to a single

  customer and are more expensive than regular On-Demand instances.
