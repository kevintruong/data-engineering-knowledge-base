**Explanation:**

AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications

and other devices. AWS IoT Core can support billions of devices and trillions of messages and can process and route

those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely.

* ✅ :  "AWS IoT Core" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "AWS Glue" is incorrect. AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes

  it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics.

* ❌ :  "AWS DMS" is incorrect. AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and

  securely.

* ❌ :  "AWS Lambda" is incorrect. AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
