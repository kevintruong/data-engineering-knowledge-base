**Explanation:**

Amazon ElastiCache Redis is an in-memory database cache and supports high availability through replicas and multi-AZ.

The table below compares ElastiCache Redis with Memcached:

- ✅ :  "Amazon ElastiCache Redis" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Amazon ElastiCache Memcached" is incorrect as it does not support high availability or multi-AZ.

- ❌ :  "Amazon RDS Multi-AZ" is incorrect. This is not an in-memory database and it not suitable for use as a

  caching layer.

- ❌ :  "Amazon DynamoDB" is incorrect. DynamoDB is a non-relational database, you would not use it for a caching

  layer. Also, the in-memory, low-latency caching for DynamoDB is implemented using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).
