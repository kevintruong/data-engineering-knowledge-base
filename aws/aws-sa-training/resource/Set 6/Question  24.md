#### Question  24


**A customer has requested some advice on how to implement security measures in their Amazon VPC. The client has

recently been the victim of some hacking attempts. The client wants to implement measures to mitigate further threats.

The client has explained that the attacks always come from the same small block of IP addresses.**


**What would be a quick and easy measure to help prevent further attacks?**


- [ ] Use a Security Group rule that denies connections from the block of IP addresses


- [ ] Use CloudFrontâ€™s DDoS prevention features


- [ ] Create a Bastion Host restrict all connections to the Bastion Host only
