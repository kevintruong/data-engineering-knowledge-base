**Explanation:**

Every IAM user starts with no permissions. In other words, by default, users can do nothing, not even view their own

access keys. To give a user permission to do something, you can add the permission to the user (that is, attach a policy

to the user). Or you can add the user to a group that has the intended permission.

* ✅ :  "They are created with no permissions" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "They are created with limited permissions" is incorrect as they are created with no permissions.

* ❌ :  "They are created with full permissions" is incorrect as they are created with no permissions.

* ❌ :  "They are created with user privileges" is incorrect as they are created with no permissions.
