**Explanation:**

With ALB and NLB IP addresses can be used to register:

* Instances in a peered VPC.

* AWS resources that are addressable by IP address and port.

* On-premises resources linked to AWS through Direct Connect or a VPN connection.

* ✅ :  "This is possible using the Network Load Balancer (NLB) and Application Load Balancer (ALB) if using IP

  addresses as targets" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "This is not possible, the instances that an ELB routes traffic to must be in the same VPC" is incorrect.

  Instances can be in peered VPCs.

* ❌ :  "This is possible using the Classic Load Balancer (CLB) if using Instance IDs" is incorrect. This is not

  possible with the CLB.

* ❌ :  "This is not possible with ELB, you would need to use Route 53" is incorrect. This is not true, as detailed

  above.
