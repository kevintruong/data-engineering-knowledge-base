#### Question  65


**An organization in the agriculture sector is deploying sensors and smart devices around factory plants and fields. The

devices will collect information and send it to cloud applications running on AWS.**


**Which AWS service will securely connect the devices to the cloud applications?**


1: AWS Glue


2: AWS IoT Core


3: AWS DMS


4: AWS Lambda


**Answer: 2**


**Explanation:**


AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications

and other devices. AWS IoT Core can support billions of devices and trillions of messages and can process and route

those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely.

  it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics.


- INCORRECT "AWS DMS" is incorrect. AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and

  securely.


- INCORRECT "AWS Lambda" is incorrect. AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
