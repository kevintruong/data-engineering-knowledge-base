#### Question  22


**An application is generating a large amount of clickstream events data that is being stored on S3. The business needs

to understand customer behavior and want to run complex analytics queries against the data.**


**Which AWS service can be used for this requirement?**


1: Amazon RedShift


2: Amazon Neptune


3: Amazon RDS


4: Amazon Kinesis Firehose


**Answer: 1**


**Explanation:**


Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data

using standard SQL and existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools.


RedShift is used for running complex analytic queries against petabytes of structured data, using sophisticated query

optimization, columnar storage on high-performance local disks, and massively parallel query execution.


With RedShift you can load data from Amazon S3 and perform analytics queries. RedShift Spectrum can analyze data

directly in Amazon S3 but was not presented as an option.


- CORRECT "Amazon RedShift" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Amazon Neptune" is incorrect. Amazon Neptune is a new product that offers a fully-managed Graph database.


- INCORRECT "Amazon RDS" is incorrect. RDS is a relational database that is used for transactional workloads not

  analytics workloads.


- INCORRECT "Amazon Kinesis Firehose" is incorrect. Amazon Kinesis Firehose processes streaming data, not data stored on

  S3.
