**Explanation:**

Amazon DynamoDB is a no-SQL database that stores data using key-value pairs. It is ideal for storing large amounts of

semi-structured data and is also highly scalable. This is the best solution for storing this data based on the

requirements in the scenario.

- ✅ :  "Amazon DynamoDB" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Amazon EFS" is incorrect. The Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is not suitable for storing key- value

  pairs.

- ❌ :  "Amazon RDS MySQL" is incorrect. Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is used for structured data as it

  is an SQL type of database.

- ❌ :  "Amazon EBS" is incorrect. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block-based storage system. You attach

  volumes to EC2 instances. It is not used for key-value pairs or to be used by Lambda functions.
