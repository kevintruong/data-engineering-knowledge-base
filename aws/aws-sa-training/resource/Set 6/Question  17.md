#### Question  17


**A company has a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) that are a mixture of c4.2xlarge

instance types and c5.large instances. The load on the CPUs on the c5.large instances has been very high, often hitting

100% utilization, whereas the c4.2xlarge instances have been performing well.**


**What should a Solutions Architect recommend to resolve the performance issues?**


- [ ] Enable the weighted routing policy on the ELB and configure a higher weighting for the c4.2xlarge instances


- [ ] Add all of the instances into a Placement Group


- [x] Change the configuration to use only c4.2xlarge instance types


- [ ] Add more c5.large instances to spread the load more evenly
