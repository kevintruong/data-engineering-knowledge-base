#### Question  31


**A customer is deploying services in a hybrid cloud model. The customer has mandated that data is transferred directly

between cloud data centers, bypassing ISPs.**


**Which AWS service can be used to enable hybrid cloud connectivity?**


1: AWS Direct Connect


2: Amazon VPC


3: IPSec VPN


4: Amazon Route 53


**Answer: 1**


**Explanation:**


With AWS Direct Connect, you can connect to all your AWS resources in an AWS Region, transfer your business-critical

data directly from your datacenter, office, or colocation environment into and from AWS, bypassing your Internet service

provider and removing network congestion.


- CORRECT "AWS Direct Connect" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Amazon VPC" is incorrect. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources

  into a virtual network that youâ€™ve defined.


- INCORRECT "IPSec VPN" is incorrect. An IPSec VPN can be used to connect to AWS however it does not bypass the ISPs or

  Internet.


- INCORRECT "Amazon Route 53" is incorrect. Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name

  System (DNS) web service.
