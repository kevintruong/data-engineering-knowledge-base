#### Question  18


**A Solutions Architect created a new IAM user account for a temporary employee who recently joined the company. The

user does not have permissions to perform any actions, which statement is true about newly created users in IAM?**


1: They are created with no permissions


2: They are created with limited permissions


3: They are created with full permissions


4: They are created with user privileges


**Answer: 1**


**Explanation:**


Every IAM user starts with no permissions. In other words, by default, users can do nothing, not even view their own

access keys. To give a user permission to do something, you can add the permission to the user (that is, attach a policy

to the user). Or you can add the user to a group that has the intended permission.


- CORRECT "They are created with no permissions" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "They are created with limited permissions" is incorrect as they are created with no permissions.


- INCORRECT "They are created with full permissions" is incorrect as they are created with no permissions.


- INCORRECT "They are created with user privileges" is incorrect as they are created with no permissions.
