#### Question  37


**A web application receives order processing information from customers and places the messages on an Amazon SQS queue.

A fleet of Amazon EC2 instances are configured to pick up the messages, process them, and store the results in a

DynamoDB table. The current configuration has been resulting in a large number of empty responses to ReceiveMessage API

requests.**


**A Solutions Architect needs to eliminate empty responses to reduce operational overhead. How can this be done?**


1: Use a Standard queue to provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once


2: Use a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue to preserve the exact order in which messages are sent and received


3: Configure Long Polling to eliminate empty responses by allowing Amazon SQS to wait until a message is available in a

queue before sending a response


4: Configure Short Polling to eliminate empty responses by reducing the length of time a connection request remains open


**Answer: 3**


**Explanation:**


The correct answer is to use Long Polling which will eliminate empty responses by allowing Amazon SQS to wait until a

message is available in a queue before sending a response.


The problem does not relate to the order in which the messages are processed in and there are no concerns over messages

being delivered more than once so it doesnâ€™t matter whether you use a FIFO or standard queue.


**Long Polling:**


- Uses fewer requests and reduces cost.

- Eliminates false empty responses by querying all servers.

- SQS waits until a message is available in the queue before sending a response.


**Short Polling:**


- Does not wait for messages to appear in the queue.

- It queries only a subset of the available servers for messages (based on weighted random execution).

- Short polling is the default.

- ReceiveMessageWaitTime is set to 0.


- CORRECT "Configure Long Polling to eliminate empty responses by allowing Amazon SQS to wait until a message is

  available in a queue before sending a response" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Use a Standard queue to provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least

  once" is incorrect as explained above.


- INCORRECT "Use a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue to preserve the exact order in which messages are sent and received"

  is incorrect as explained above.


- INCORRECT "Configure Short Polling to eliminate empty responses by reducing the length of time a connection request

  remains open" is incorrect as explained above.
