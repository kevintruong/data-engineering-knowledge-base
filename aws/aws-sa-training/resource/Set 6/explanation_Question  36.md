**Explanation:**

Access Logs can be enabled on ALB and configured to store data in an S3 bucket. Amazon EMR is a web service that enables

businesses, researchers, data analysts, and developers to easily and cost-effectively process vast amounts of data. EMR

utilizes a hosted Hadoop framework running on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.

* ✅ :  "Configure Access Logs to be delivered to S3 and use EMR for processing the log files" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Configure Access Logs to be delivered to EC2 and install Hadoop for processing the log files" is incorrect.

  EC2 does not provide a hosted Hadoop service.

* ❌ :  "Configure Access Logs to be delivered to DynamoDB and use EMR for processing the log files" is incorrect.

  You cannot configure access logs to be delivered to DynamoDB.

* ❌ :  "Configure Access Logs to be delivered to S3 and use Kinesis for processing the log files" is incorrect.
