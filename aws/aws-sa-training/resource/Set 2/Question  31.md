#### Question  31

**A web application is deployed in multiple regions behind an ELB Application Load Balancer. You need deterministic

routing to the closest region and automatic failover. Traffic should traverse the AWS global network for consistent

performance.**

**How can this be achieved?**

- [x] Configure AWS Global Accelerator and configure the ALBs as targets

- [ ] Place an EC2 Proxy in front of the ALB and configure automatic failover

- [ ] Create a Route 53 Alias record for each ALB and configure a latency-based routing policy

- [ ] Use a CloudFront distribution with multiple custom origins in each region and configure for high availability
