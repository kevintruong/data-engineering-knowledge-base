#### Question  16

weeks.**


**What is the MOST cost-effective solution?**


- [ ] Create an AWS Direct Connect connection and migrate the data straight into Amazon Glacier


- [ ] Order 7 AWS Snowball appliances and select an S3 Glacier vault as the destination. Create a bucket policy to enforce

a VPC endpoint

- [x] Order 7 AWS Snowball appliances and select an Amazon S3 bucket as the destination. Create a lifecycle policy to

transition the S3 objects to Amazon S3 Glacier
