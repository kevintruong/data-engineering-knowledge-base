#### Question  3


**A solutions architect is finalizing the architecture for a distributed database that will run across multiple Amazon

EC2 instances. Data will be replicated across all instances so the loss of an instance will not cause loss of data. The

database requires block storage with low latency and throughput that supports up to several million transactions per

second per server.**


**Which storage solution should the solutions architect use?**


- [ ] Amazon EBS


- [x] Amazon EC2 instance store
