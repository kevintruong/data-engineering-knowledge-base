#### Question  7


**A web application has recently been launched on AWS. The architecture includes two tier with a web layer and a

database later. It has been identified that the web server layer may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks.**


**What should a solutions architect do to remediate the vulnerability?**


- [ ] Create a Classic Load Balancer. Put the web layer behind the load balancer and enable AWS WAF


- [ ] Create a Network Load Balancer. Put the web layer behind the load balancer and enable AWS WAF


- [x] Create an Application Load Balancer. Put the web layer behind the load balancer and enable AWS WAF


- [ ] Create an Application Load Balancer. Put the web layer behind the load balancer and use AWS Shield Standard
