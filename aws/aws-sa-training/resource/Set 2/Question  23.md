#### Question  23


**Objects uploaded to Amazon S3 are initially accessed frequently for a period of 30 days. Then, objects are

infrequently accessed for up to 90 days. After that, the objects are no longer needed.**


**How should lifecycle management be configured?**


1: Transition to STANDARD_IA after 30 days. After 90 days transition to GLACIER


2: Transition to STANDARD_IA after 30 days. After 90 days transition to ONEZONE_IA


3: Transition to ONEZONE_IA after 30 days. After 90 days expire the objects


4: Transition to REDUCED_REDUNDANCY after 30 days. After 90 days expire the objects


Answer: 3


**Explanation:**


In this scenario we need to keep the objects in the STANDARD storage class for 30 days as the objects are being

frequently accessed. We can configure a lifecycle action that then transitions the objects to INTELLIGENT_TIERING,

STANDARD_IA, or ONEZONE_IA. After that we donâ€™t need the objects so they can be expired.


All other options do not meet the stated requirements or are not supported lifecycle transitions. For example:


- You cannot transition to REDUCED_REDUNDANCY from any storage class.

- Transitioning from STANDARD_IA to ONEZONE_IA is possible but we do not want to keep the objects so it incurs

  unnecessary costs.

- Transitioning to GLACIER is possible but again incurs unnecessary costs.


- CORRECT "Transition to ONEZONE_IA after 30 days. After 90 days expire the objects " is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Transition to STANDARD_IA after 30 days. After 90 days transition to GLACIER" is incorrect.


- INCORRECT "Transition to STANDARD_IA after 30 days. After 90 days transition to ONEZONE_IA" is incorrect.


- INCORRECT "Transition to REDUCED_REDUNDANCY after 30 days. After 90 days expire the objects " is incorrect.
