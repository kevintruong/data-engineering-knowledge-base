#### Question  36


**You would like to grant additional permissions to an individual ECS application container on an ECS cluster that you

have deployed. You would like to do this without granting additional permissions to the other containers that are

running on the cluster.**


**How can you achieve this?**


- [x] Create a separate Task Definition for the application container that uses a different Task Role


- [ ] In the same Task Definition, specify a separate Task Role for the application container


- [ ] Use EC2 instances instead as you can assign different IAM roles on each instance


- [ ] You cannot implement granular permissions with ECS containers
