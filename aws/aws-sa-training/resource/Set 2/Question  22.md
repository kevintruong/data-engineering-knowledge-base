#### Question  22


**An organization is creating a new storage solution and needs to ensure that Amazon S3 objects that are deleted are

immediately restorable for up to 30 days. After 30 days the objects should be retained for a further 180 days and be

restorable within 24 hours.**


**The solution should be operationally simple and cost-effective. How can these requirements be achieved?

(Select TWO)**


- [x] Enable object versioning on the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the objects


- [x] Create a lifecycle rule to transition non-current versions to GLACIER after 30 days, and then expire the objects

after 180 days


- [ ] Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete protection


- [ ] Enable cross-region replication (CRR) for the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the objects


- [ ] Create a lifecycle rule to transition non-current versions to STANDARD_IA after 30 days, and then expire the objects

after 180 days
