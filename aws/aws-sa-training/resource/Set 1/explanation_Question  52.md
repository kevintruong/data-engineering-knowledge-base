**Explanation:**

Kinesis Data Streams enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data for specialized

needs. The diagram below shows the architecture of a Kinesis Data Streams application:

Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to process and analyze real-time, streaming data. Kinesis Data

Analytics can use standard SQL queries to process Kinesis data streams and can ingest data from Kinesis Streams and

Kinesis Firehose.

- ✅ :  "Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Data Analytics" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "DynamoDB and EMR" is incorrect. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that can be used for storing data from a

  stream but cannot be used to process or analyze the data or to query it with SQL queries. Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) is

  a hosted Hadoop framework and is not used for analytics on streaming data.

- ❌ :  "ElastiCache and EMR" is incorrect as ElastiCache is an in-memory database cache service, it is not used for

  streaming data. Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) is a hosted Hadoop framework and is not used for analytics on streaming data.

- ❌ :  "Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Firehose" is incorrect. Firehose cannot be used for running SQL queries.
