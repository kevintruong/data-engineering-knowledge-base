#### Question  46


**You are a Solutions Architect at Digital Cloud Training. One of your clients runs an application that writes data to a

DynamoDB table. The client has asked how they can implement a function that runs code in response to item level changes

that take place in the DynamoDB table. What would you suggest to the client?**


- [ ] Enable server access logging and create an event source mapping between AWS Lambda and the S3 bucket to which the

logs are written


- [x] Enable DynamoDB Streams and create an event source mapping between AWS Lambda and the relevant stream


- [ ] Create a local secondary index that records item level changes and write some custom code that responds to updates to

the index


- [ ] Use Kinesis Data Streams and configure DynamoDB as a producer
