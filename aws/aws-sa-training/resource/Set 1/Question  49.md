#### Question  49

**An application you manage uses Auto Scaling and a fleet of EC2 instances. You recently noticed that Auto Scaling is

scaling the number of instances up and down multiple times in the same hour. You need to implement a remediation to

reduce the amount of scaling events. The remediation must be cost-effective and preserve elasticity. What design changes

would you implement? (Select TWO)**

- [x] Modify the CloudWatch alarm period that triggers your Auto Scaling scale down policy

- [ ] Modify the Auto Scaling group termination policy to terminate the newest instance first

- [ ] Modify the Auto Scaling group termination policy to terminate the oldest instance first

- [x] Modify the Auto Scaling group cool-down timers

- [ ] Modify the Auto Scaling policy to use scheduled scaling actions
