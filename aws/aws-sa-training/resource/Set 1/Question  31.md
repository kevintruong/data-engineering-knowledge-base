#### Question  31


**An AWS Organization has an OU with multiple member accounts in it. The company needs to restrict the ability to launch

only specific Amazon EC2 instance types. How can this policy be applied across the accounts with the least effort?**


- [ ] Create an SCP with an allow rule that allows launching the specific instance types


- [x] Create an SCP with a deny rule that denies all but the specific instance types


- [ ] Create an IAM policy to deny launching all but the specific instance types


- [ ] Use AWS Resource Access Manager to control which launch types can be used
