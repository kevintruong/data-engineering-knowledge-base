#### Question  35


**A new application is to be published in multiple regions around the world. The Architect needs to ensure only 2 IP

addresses need to be whitelisted. The solution should intelligently route traffic for lowest latency and provide fast

regional failover.**


**How can this be achieved?**


- [ ] Launch EC2 instances into multiple regions behind an NLB with a static IP address


- [ ] Launch EC2 instances into multiple regions behind an ALB and use a Route 53 failover routing policy


- [x] Launch EC2 instances into multiple regions behind an NLB and use AWS Global Accelerator


- [ ] Launch EC2 instances into multiple regions behind an ALB and use Amazon CloudFront with a pair of static IP addresses
