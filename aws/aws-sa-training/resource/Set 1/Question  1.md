#### Question  1


**An application is being created that will use Amazon EC2 instances to generate and store data. Another set of EC2

instances will then analyze and modify the data. Storage requirements will be significant and will continue to grow over

time. The application architects require a storage solution.**


**Which actions would meet these needs?**


- [ ] Store the data in an Amazon EBS volume. Mount the EBS volume on the application instances


- [x] Store the data in an Amazon EFS filesystem. Mount the file system on the application instances


- [ ] Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier. Update the vault policy to allow access to the application instances


- [ ] Store the data in AWS Storage Gateway. Setup AWS Direct Connect between the Gateway appliance and the EC2 instances
