#### Question  33

**An Amazon RDS Read Replica is being deployed in a separate region. The master database is not encrypted but all data

in the new region must be encrypted. How can this be achieved?**

- [ ] Enable encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) when creating the cross-region Read Replica

- [ ] Encrypt a snapshot from the master DB instance, create an encrypted cross-region Read Replica from the snapshot

- [ ] Enabled encryption on the master DB instance, then create an encrypted cross-region Read Replica

- [x] Encrypt a snapshot from the master DB instance, create a new encrypted master DB instance, and then create an

encrypted cross-region Read Replica
