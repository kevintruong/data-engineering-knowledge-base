#### Question  51


**An application tier of a multi-tier web application currently hosts two web services on the same set of instances. The

web services each listen for traffic on different ports. Which AWS service should a Solutions Architect use to route

traffic to the service based on the incoming request path?**


1: Amazon Route 53


2: Amazon CloudFront


3: Application Load Balancer (ALB)


4: Classic Load Balancer (CLB)


Answer: 3


**Explanation:**


An Application Load Balancer is a type of Elastic Load Balancer that can use layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) protocol data to make

forwarding decisions. An ALB supports both path-based (e.g. /images or /orders) and host-based routing (e.g.

example.com).


In this scenario a single EC2 instance is listening for traffic for each application on a different port. You can use a

target group that listens on a single port (HTTP or HTTPS) and then uses listener rules to selectively route to a

different port on the EC2 instance based on the information in the URL path. So you might have example.com/images going

to one backend port and example.com/orders going to a different backend port.


- CORRECT "Application Load Balancer (ALB)" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Amazon Route 53" is incorrect. Amazon Route 53 is a DNS service. It can be used to load balance however it

  does not have the ability to route based on information in the incoming request path.


- INCORRECT "Amazon CloudFront" is incorrect. Amazon CloudFront is used for caching content. It can route based on

  request path to custom origins however the question is not requesting a content caching service so it’s not the best

  fit for this use case.


- INCORRECT "Classic Load Balancer (CLB)" is incorrect. You cannot use host-based or path-based routing with a CLB.
