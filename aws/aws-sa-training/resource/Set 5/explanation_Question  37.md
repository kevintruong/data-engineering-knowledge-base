**Explanation:**

You can use the condition checking in IAM policies to look for a specific tag. IAM checks that the tag attached to the

principal making the request matches the specified key name and value.

* ✅ :  "Create an IAM policy that grants access to any instances with the specific tag and attach to the users and

  groups" is the correct answer.

* ✅ :  "Add a specific tag to the instances you want to grant the users or groups access to" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Attach an Identity Provider (IdP) and delegate access to the instances to the relevant groups" is

  incorrect. You cannot use an IdP for this solution.

* ❌ :  "Create an IAM policy with a conditional statement that matches the environment variables" is incorrect as

  the statement should be checking for the tag.

* ❌ :  "Add an environment variable to the instances using user data" is incorrect. You cannot achieve this outcome

  using environment variables stored in user data and conditional statements in a policy. You must use an IAM policy

  that grants access to instances based on the tag.
