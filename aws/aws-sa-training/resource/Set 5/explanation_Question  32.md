**Explanation:**

With Amazon API Gateway, you can run a fully managed REST API that integrates with Lambda to execute your business logic

and includes traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API versioning.

AWS Step Functions orchestrates serverless workflows including coordination, state, and function chaining as well as

combining long-running executions not supported within Lambda execution limits by breaking into multiple steps or by

calling workers running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances or on- premises.

* ✅ :  "Use AWS Step Functions for orchestrating serverless workflows" is the correct answer.

* ✅ :  "Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda for executing the business logics" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Use Amazon ECS for executing the business logic" is incorrect. The Amazon Elastic Container Service (

  ECS) is not a serverless application stack, containers run on EC2 instances.

* ❌ :  "Use AWS CloudFormation for orchestrating serverless workflows" is incorrect. AWS CloudFormation is used for

  describing and provisioning resources not actually performing workflow functions within the application.

* ❌ :  "Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for executing the business logic" is incorrect. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is used for

  describing and provisioning resources not actually performing workflow functions within the application.
