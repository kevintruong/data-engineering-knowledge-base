**Explanation:**

Amazon Redshift is an enterprise-level, petabyte scale, fully managed data warehousing service. It uses columnar storage

to improve the performance of complex queries.

You can use the COPY command to load data in parallel from one or more remote hosts, such Amazon EC2 instances or other

computers. COPY connects to the remote hosts using SSH and executes commands on the remote hosts to generate text

output.

- ✅ :  "Use the COPY command to load data into an Amazon RedShift data warehouse and run the analytics queries there"

  is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Run an AWS Batch job to copy and process the data into a columnar Amazon RDS database. Use Amazon Athena to

  analyze the data" is incorrect. AWS Batch is used for running batch computing jobs across a fleet of EC2 instances.

  You cannot create a “columnar Amazon RDS database” as RDS is optimized for transactional workloads. Athena is used to

  analyze data on S3.

- ❌ :  "Launch Amazon Kinesis Data Streams producers to load data into a Kinesis Data stream. Use Kinesis Data

  Analytics to analyze the data" is incorrect. Kinesis is a real-time streaming data service. It is not a columnar

  database so is unsuitable for this use case.

- ❌ :  "Create an AWS Lambda function that copies the data onto Amazon S3. Use Amazon S3 Select to query the data"

  is incorrect. S3 is not a columnar database and S3 select does not run analytics queries, it simply selects data from

  an object to retrieve.
