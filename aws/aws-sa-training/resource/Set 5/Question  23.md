#### Question  23


**An application is running on EC2 instances in a private subnet of an Amazon VPC. A Solutions Architect would like to

connect the application to Amazon API Gateway. For security reasons, it is necessary to ensure that no traffic traverses

the Internet and to ensure all traffic uses private IP addresses only.**


**How can this be achieved?**


- [ ] Create a NAT gateway


- [ ] Create a public VIF on a Direct Connect connection


- [x] Create a private API using an interface VPC endpoint


- [ ] Add the API gateway to the subnet the EC2 instances are located in
