#### Question  20


**A Solutions Architect is designing an application for processing and extracting data from log files. The log files are

generated by an application and the number and frequency of updates varies. The files are up to 1 GB in size and

processing will take around 40 seconds for each file.**


**Which solution is the most cost-effective?**


- [ ] Write the log files to an Amazon EC2 instance with an attached EBS volume. After processing, save the files to an

Amazon S3 bucket


- [ ] Write the log files to an Amazon SQS queue. Use AWS Lambda to process the files from the queue and save to an Amazon

S3 bucket


- [ ] Write the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an event notification to invoke an Amazon ECS task to process the

files and save to an Amazon S3 bucket


- [x] Write the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an event notification to invoke an AWS Lambda function that will

process the files
