#### Question  36


**An operations team would like to be notified if an RDS database exceeds certain metric thresholds. How can a Solutions

Architect automate this process for the operations team?**


1: Create a CloudWatch alarm and associate an SQS queue with it that delivers a message to SES


2: Setup an RDS alarm and associate an SNS topic with it that sends an email


3: Create a CloudTrail alarm and configure a notification event to send an SMS


4: Create a CloudWatch alarm and associate an SNS topic with it that sends an email notification


**Answer: 4**


**Explanation:**


You can create a CloudWatch alarm that watches a single CloudWatch metric or the result of a math expression based on

CloudWatch metrics. The alarm performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric or expression relative to a

threshold over a number of time periods.


The action can be an Amazon EC2 action, an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling action, or a notification sent to an Amazon SNS

topic. SNS can be configured to send an email notification


- CORRECT "Create a CloudWatch alarm and associate an SNS topic with it that sends an email notification" is the correct

  answer.


- INCORRECT "Create a CloudWatch alarm and associate an SQS queue with it that delivers a message to SES" is incorrect.

  You cannot associate an SQS queue with a CloudWatch alarm.


- INCORRECT "Setup an RDS alarm and associate an SNS topic with it that sends an email" is incorrect. CloudWatch

  performs performance monitoring so you donâ€™t setup alarms in RDS itself.


- INCORRECT "Create a CloudTrail alarm and configure a notification event to send an SMS" is incorrect. CloudTrail is

  used for auditing API access, not for performance monitoring.
