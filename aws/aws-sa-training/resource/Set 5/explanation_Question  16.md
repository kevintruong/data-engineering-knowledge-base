**Explanation:**

The term warm standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment

is always running in the cloud. A warm standby solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation.

It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running. By identifying your business- critical

systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on.

- ✅ :  "Warm standby" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Backup and restore" is incorrect. This is the lowest cost DR approach that simply entails creating online

  backups of all data and applications.

- ❌ :  Pilot light"" is incorrect. With a pilot light strategy a core minimum of services are running and the

  remainder are only brought online during a disaster recovery situation.

- ❌ :  "Multi-site" is incorrect. A multi-site solution runs on AWS as well as on your existing on-site

  infrastructure in an active- active configuration.
