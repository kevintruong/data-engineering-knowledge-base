#### Question  15


**A company has several AWS accounts each with multiple Amazon VPCs. The company must establish routing between all

private subnets. The architecture should be simple and allow transitive routing to occur.**


**How should the network connectivity be configured?**


- [ ] Create a transitive VPC peering connection between each Amazon VPC and configure route tables


- [x] Create an AWS Transit Gateway and share it with each account using AWS Resource Access Manager


- [ ] Create an AWS Managed VPN between each Amazon VPC and configure route tables


- [ ] Create a hub-and-spoke topology with AWS App Mesh and use AWS Resource Access Manager to share route tables
