#### Question  43

**A new application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The company is planning on running

an advertising campaign that will likely result in significant hits to the application after each ad is run.**

**A Solutions Architect is concerned about the impact this may have on the application and would like to put in place

some controls to limit the number of requests per second that hit the application.**

**What controls should the Solutions Architect implement?**

- [x] Implement throttling rules on the API Gateway

- [ ] Enable caching on the API Gateway and specify a size in gigabytes

- [ ] Enable Lambda continuous scaling

- [ ] API Gateway and Lambda scale automatically to handle any load so thereâ€™s no need to implement controls
