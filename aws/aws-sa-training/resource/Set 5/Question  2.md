#### Question  2

**A Solutions Architect is deploying a high performance computing (HPC) application on Amazon EC2 instances. The

application requires extremely low inter-instance latency. How should the instances be deployed for BEST performance?**

- [ ] :  Use an instance with enhanced networking and deploy the instances in a partition placement group

- [x] :  Use an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) and deploy instances in a cluster placement group

- [ ] :  Add multiple Elastic Network Adapters (ENAs) to each instance and create a NIC team

- [ ] :  Use an EBS-optimized instance with 10 Gigabit networking and deploy to a single subnet
