#### Question  2


**A Solutions Architect is deploying a high performance computing (HPC) application on Amazon EC2 instances. The

application requires extremely low inter-instance latency. How should the instances be deployed for BEST performance?**


- [ ] Use an instance with enhanced networking and deploy the instances in a partition placement group


- [x] Use an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) and deploy instances in a cluster placement group


- [ ] Add multiple Elastic Network Adapters (ENAs) to each instance and create a NIC team


- [ ] Use an EBS-optimized instance with 10 Gigabit networking and deploy to a single subnet
