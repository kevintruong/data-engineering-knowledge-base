#### Question  3


**A company has deployed an API using Amazon API Gateway. There are many repeat requests and a solutions architect has

been asked to implement measures to reduce request latency and the number of calls to the Amazon EC2 endpoint.**


**How can this be most easily achieved?**


1: Create a cache for a stage and configure a TTL


2: Create a cache for a method and configure a TTL


3: Configure an edge-optimized endpoint with CloudFront


4: Configure a private endpoint place ElastiCache in front


Answer: 1


**Explanation:**


You can enable API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoint's responses. With caching, you can reduce the

number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your API.


When you enable caching for a stage, API Gateway caches responses from your endpoint for a specified time- to-live (TTL)

period, in seconds. API Gateway then responds to the request by looking up the endpoint response from the cache instead

of making a request to your endpoint. The default TTL value for API caching is 300 seconds. The maximum TTL value is

3600 seconds. TTL=0 means caching is disabled.


- CORRECT "Create a cache for a stage and configure a TTL" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Create a cache for a method and configure a TTL" is incorrect. An API cache is not enabled for a method, it

  is enabled for a stage.


- INCORRECT "Configure an edge-optimized endpoint with CloudFront" is incorrect. This is the default endpoint type with

  API Gateway so thereâ€™s no reason to believe the solution architect needs to configure this. Users are

routed to the nearest CloudFront point of presence (POP). However, caching still takes place within API gateway using a

stage cache.


- INCORRECT "Configure a private endpoint place ElastiCache in front" is incorrect. You cannot use Amazon ElastiCache to

  cache API requests.
