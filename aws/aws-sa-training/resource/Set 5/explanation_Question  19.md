- ✅ :  "Amazon ElastiCache Memcached" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Amazon ElastiCache Redis" is incorrect. The Redis engine does not support multiple CPU cores or threads.

- ❌ :  "Amazon DynamoDB DAX" is incorrect. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a database cache that should be

  used with DynamoDB only.

- ❌ :  "Amazon RDS MySQL" is incorrect as this is not an example of an in-memory database that can be used as a

  database caching layer.
