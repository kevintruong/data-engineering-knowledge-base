#### Question  49

**A Solutions Architect just completed the implementation of a 2-tier web application for a client. The application uses

Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon ELB and Auto Scaling across two subnets. After deployment the Solutions Architect noticed

that only one subnet has EC2 instances running in it. What might be the cause of this situation?**

- [ ] The ELB is configured as an internal-only load balancer

- [x] The Auto Scaling Group has not been configured with multiple subnets

- [ ] Cross-zone load balancing is not enabled on the ELB

- [ ] The AMI is missing from the ASGâ€™s launch configuration
