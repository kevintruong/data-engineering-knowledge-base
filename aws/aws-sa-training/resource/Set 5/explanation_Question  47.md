**Explanation:**

To enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC, you must provide additional VPC- specific

configuration information that includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs. AWS Lambda uses this information to set

up elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that enable your function.
