**Explanation:**

AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It makes it easy for

teams to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem. CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your

own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure. You can use CodeCommit to securely store anything

from source code to binaries, and it works seamlessly with your existing Git tools.
