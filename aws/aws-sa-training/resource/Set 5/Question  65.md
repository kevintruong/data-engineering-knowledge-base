#### Question  65


**The development team in a media organization is moving their SDLC processes into the AWS Cloud. Which AWS service can

a Solutions Architect recommend that is primarily used for software version control?**


1: CloudHSM


2: CodeStar


3: CodeCommit


4: Step Functions


**Answer: 3**


**Explanation:**


AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It makes it easy for

teams to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem. CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your

own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure. You can use CodeCommit to securely store anything

from source code to binaries, and it works seamlessly with your existing Git tools.


- CORRECT "CodeCommit" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "CloudHSM" is incorrect. AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to

  easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud


- INCORRECT "CodeStar" is incorrect. AWS CodeStar enables you to quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on

  AWS..


- INCORRECT "Step Functions" is incorrect. AWS Step Functions lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless

  workflows so you can build and update apps quickly.
