#### Question  59


**The application development team in a company have created a new application written in .NET. A Solutions Architect is

looking for a way to easily deploy the application whilst maintaining full control of the underlying resources.**


**Which PaaS service provided by AWS would BEST suit this requirement?**


1: CloudFront


2: Elastic Beanstalk


3: EC2 Placement Groups


4: CloudFormation


**Answer: 2**


**Explanation:**


AWS Elastic Beanstalk can be used to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud. Developers upload

applications and Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing,

auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. It is considered to be a Platform as a Service (PaaS)

solution and allows full control of the underlying resources.


- CORRECT "Elastic Beanstalk" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "CloudFront" is incorrect. CloudFront is a content delivery network for caching content to improve

  performance.


- INCORRECT "EC2 Placement Groups" is incorrect. EC2 Placement Groups are used to control how instances are launched to

  enable low-latency connectivity or to be spread across distinct hardware.


- INCORRECT "CloudFormation" is incorrect. CloudFormation uses templates to provision infrastructure.
