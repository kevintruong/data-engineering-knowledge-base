#### Question  27


**A Solutions Architect is creating a solution for an application that must be deployed on Amazon EC2 hosts that are

dedicated to the client. Instance placement must be automatic and billing should be per instance.**


**Which type of EC2 deployment model should be used?**


1: Reserved Instance


2: Dedicated Instance


3: Dedicated Host


4: Cluster Placement Group


**Answer: 2**


**Explanation:**


Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware thatâ€™s dedicated to a single customer. Your

Dedicated instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that belong to other AWS accounts.

Dedicated instances allow automatic instance placement and billing is per instance.


- CORRECT "Dedicated Instance" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Reserved Instance" is incorrect. Reserved instances are a method of reducing cost by committing to a fixed

  contract term of 1 or 3 years..


- INCORRECT "Dedicated Host" is incorrect. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity

  fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you address compliance requirements and reduce costs by allowing

  you to use your existing server-bound software licenses. With dedicated hosts billing is on a per-host basis (

  not per instance).


- INCORRECT "Cluster Placement Group" is incorrect. A Cluster Placement Group determines how instances are placed on

  underlying hardware to enable low-latency connectivity.
