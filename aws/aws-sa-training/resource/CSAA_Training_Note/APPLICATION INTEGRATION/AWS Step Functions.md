### AWS Step Functions

AWS Step Functions makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed
applications as a series of steps in a

visual workflow.

You can quickly build and run state machines to execute the steps of your
application in a reliable and scalable

fashion.

**How it works:**

1. Define the steps of your workflow in the JSON-based Amazon States Language.
   The visual console automatically graphs

   each step in the order of execution.

2. Start an execution to visualize and verify the steps of your application are
   operating as intended. The console

   highlights the real-time status of each step and provides a detailed history
   of every execution.

3. AWS Step Functions operates and scales the steps of your application and
   underlying compute for you to help ensure

   your application executes reliably under increasing demand.

Managed workflow and orchestration platform.

Scalable and highly available.

Define your app as a state machine.

Create tasks, sequential steps, parallel steps, branching paths or timers.

Amazon State Language declarative JSON.

Apps can interact and update the stream via Step Function API.

Visual interface describes flow and real-time status.

Detailed logs of each step execution.

**Benefits and Features:**

- **Built-in error handling –** AWS Step Functions tracks the state of each
  step, so you can automatically retry failed

  or timed-out tasks, catch specific errors, and recover gracefully, whether the
  task takes seconds or months to

  complete.

- **Automatic Scaling –** AWS Step Functions automatically scales the operations
  and underlying compute to run the steps

  of your application for you in response to changing workloads. Step Functions
  scales automatically to help ensure the

  performance of your application workflow remains consistently high as the
  frequency of requests increases.

- **Pay per use –** With AWS Step Functions, you pay only for the transition
  from one step of your application workflow

  to the next, called a state transition. Billing is metered by state
  transition, regardless of how long each state

  persists (up to one year).

- **Execution event history –** AWS Step Functions creates a detailed event log
  for every execution, so when things do

  go wrong, you can quickly identify not only where, but why. All of the
  execution history is available visually and

  programmatically to quickly troubleshoot and remediate failures.

- **High availability –** AWS Step Functions has built-in fault tolerance. Step
  Functions maintains service capacity

  across multiple Availability Zones in each region to help protect application
  workflows against individual machine or

  data center facility failures. There are no maintenance windows or scheduled
  downtimes.

- **Administrative security –** AWS Step Functions is integrated with AWS
  Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM

  policies can be used to control access to the Step Functions APIs.
