##### Question 5


You are a developer at Digital Cloud Training. An application stack you are building needs a message bus to decouple the

application components from each other. The application will generate up to 300 messages per second without using

batching. You need to ensure that a message is only delivered once, and duplicates are not introduced into the queue. It

is not necessary to maintain the order of the messages.


Which SQS queue type will you use?


```

A. Standard queues

B. Long polling queues

C. Auto Scaling queues

D. FIFO queues

```
