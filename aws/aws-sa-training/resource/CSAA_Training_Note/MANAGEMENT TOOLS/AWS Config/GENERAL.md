#### GENERAL

AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource
inventory, configuration history, and

configuration change notifications to enable security and governance.

With AWS Config you can discover existing AWS resources, export a complete
inventory of your AWS resources with all

configuration details, and determine how a resource was configured at any point
in time.

These capabilities enable compliance auditing, security analysis, resource
change tracking, and troubleshooting.

Allow you to assess, audit and evaluate configurations of your AWS resources.

Very useful for Configuration Management as part of an ITIL program.

Creates a baseline of various configuration settings and files and can then
track variations against that baseline.
