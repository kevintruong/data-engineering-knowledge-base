### AWS OpsWorks


AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet two very popular

automation platforms.


Automates how applications are configured, deployed and managed.


Provide configuration management to deploy code, automate tasks, configure instances, perform upgrades etc.


OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed, and managed across your Amazon

EC2 instances or on-premises compute environments.


OpsWorks is an automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code.


**OpsWorks consists of Stacks and Layers:**


- Stack are collections of resources needed to support a service or application.

- Stacks are containers of resources (EC2, RDS etc.) that you want to manage collectively.

- Every Stack contains one or more Layers and Layers automate the deployment of packages.

- Stacks can be cloned â€“ but only within the same region.

- Layers represent different components of the application delivery hierarchy.

- EC2 instances, RDS instances, and ELBS are examples of Layers.


OpsWorks is a global service. But when you create a stack, you must specify a region and that stack can only control

resources in that region.
