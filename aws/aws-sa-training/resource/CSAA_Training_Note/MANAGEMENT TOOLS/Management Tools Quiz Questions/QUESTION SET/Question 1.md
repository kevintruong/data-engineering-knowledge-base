##### Question 1

You are a Solutions Architect at Digital Cloud Training. A client from a large
multinational corporation is working on a

deployment of a significant amount of resources into AWS. The client would like
to be able to deploy resources across

multiple AWS accounts and regions using a single toolset and template. You have
been asked to suggest a toolset that can

provide this functionality?

```

A. Use a CloudFormation template that creates a stack and specify the logical IDs of each

account and region

B. Use a CloudFormation StackSet and specify the target accounts and regions in which the

stacks will be created

C. Use a third-party product such as Terraform that has support for multiple AWS accounts and

regions

D. This cannot be done, use separate CloudFormation templates per AWS account and region

```
