##### Question 2 answer: B

Explanation:

```

You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example,

CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you

a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify. This is the best tool

for this requirement.

Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe

changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. Though you can generate custom application-

level events and publish them to CloudWatch Events this is not the best tool for monitoring

application logs.

CloudTrail is used for monitoring API activity on your account, not for monitoring application

logs.

CloudWatch Metrics are the fundamental concept in CloudWatch. A metric represents a time-

ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch. You cannot use a metric alone; it is

used when setting up monitoring for any service in CloudWatch.
