#### USE CASES


Use AWS Glue to discover properties of data, transform it, and prepare it for analytics.


Glue can automatically discover both structured and semi-structured data stored in data lakes on Amazon S3, data

warehouses in Amazon Redshift, and various databases running on AWS.


It provides a unified view of data via the Glue Data Catalog that is available for ETL, querying and reporting using

services like Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.


Glue automatically generates Scala or Python code for ETL jobs that you can further customize using tools you are

already familiar with.


AWS Glue is serverless, so there are no compute resources to configure and manage.
