### Amazon EMR

Amazon EMR is a web service that enables businesses, researchers, data analysts,
and developers to easily and

cost-effectively process vast amounts of data.

EMR utilizes a hosted Hadoop framework running on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.

Managed Hadoop framework for processing huge amounts of data.

Also support Apache Spark, HBase, Presto and Flink.

Most commonly used for log analysis, financial analysis, or extract, translate
and loading (ETL)

activities.

A Step is a programmatic task for performing some process on the data (e.g.
count words).

A cluster is a collection of EC2 instances provisioned by EMR to run your Steps.

EMR uses Apache Hadoop as its distributed data processing engine, which is an
open source, Java software framework that

supports data-intensive distributed applications running on large clusters of
commodity hardware.

EMR is a good place to deploy Apache Spark, an open-source distributed
processing used for big data workloads which

utilizes in-memory caching and optimized query execution.

You can also launch Presto clusters. Presto is an open-source distributed SQL
query engine designed for fast analytic

queries against large datasets.

EMR launches all nodes for a given cluster in the same Amazon EC2 Availability
Zone.

You can access Amazon EMR by using the AWS Management Console, Command Line
Tools, SDKS, or the EMR API.

With EMR you have access to the underlying operating system (you can SSH in).
