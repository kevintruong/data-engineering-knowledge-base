### AWS Database Migration Service.........................................................................................

AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and
securely.

The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing
downtime to applications that rely on the

database.

The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely
used commercial and open-source

databases.

Supported migration paths include:

- On-premises and EC2 databases to Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora.

- Homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle.

- Heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle
  or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon

  Aurora.

With AWS Database Migration Service, you can continuously replicate your data
with high availability and consolidate

databases into a petabyte-scale data warehouse by streaming data to Amazon
Redshift and Amazon S3.

When migrating databases to Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB or
Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB

compatibility) you can use DMS free for six months.

Use along with the Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to migrate databases to AWS RDS
or EC2-based databases.

The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing
downtime to applications that rely on the

database.

The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely
used commercial and open-source

databases.

Schema Conversion Tool can copy database schemas for homogenous migrations (same
database)

and convert schemas for heterogeneous migrations (different database).

DMS is used for smaller, simpler conversions and also supports MongoDB and
DynamoDB.

SCT is used for larger, more complex datasets like data warehouses.

DMS has replication functions for on-premise to AWS or to Snowball or S3.
