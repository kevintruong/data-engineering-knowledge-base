uses a secure storage device for physical transportation.

The AWS Snowball Client is software that is installed on a local computer and is used to identify,

compress, encrypt, and transfer data. It uses 256 - bit encryption (managed with the AWS KMS)

and tamper-resistant enclosures with TPM.

Snowball can import to S3 or export from S3.

Snowball cannot be used with multipart upload.

You cannot use Snowball for migration between on-premise data centers.
