### AWS DataSync


AWS DataSync makes it simple and fast to move large amounts of data online between on-premises storage and Amazon S3 or

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS).


Manual tasks related to data transfers can slow down migrations and burden IT operations.


DataSync eliminates or automatically handles many of these tasks, including scripting copy jobs, scheduling and

monitoring transfers, validating data, and optimizing network utilization.


The DataSync software agent connects to your Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block

(SMB) storage, so you donâ€™t have to modify your applications.


DataSync can transfer hundreds of terabytes and millions of files over the internet or AWS Direct Connect links.


You can use DataSync to migrate active data sets or archives to AWS, transfer data to the cloud for timely analysis and

processing, or replicate data to AWS for business continuity.


DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) or Server Message Block (SMB) file servers, all Amazon Simple

Storage Service (Amazon S3) storage classes, and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems.


All data is encrypted in transit with Transport Layer Security (TLS).


DataSync supports using default encryption for S3 buckets using Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3), and Amazon

EFS file system encryption of data at rest.


Task scheduling enables you to configure periodically executing a task, to detect and copy changes from your source

storage system to the destination.


You can schedule your tasks using the AWS DataSync Console or AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), without needing to write

and run scripts to manage repeated transfers.


The DataSync agent connects to your existing storage systems using the industry-standard NFS and SMB protocols.


The agent transfers data rapidly and deposits it your designated Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system.


When copying data to Amazon S3, DataSync automatically converts each file to be a single S3 object in a 1:1 relationship

and preserves POSIX metadata as Amazon S3 object metadata.


When you copy objects that contain file system metadata back to file formats, the original file metadata that DataSync

copied to S3 is restored.


Similarly, when Amazon EFS is the destination for your data, DataSync preserves existing directory structures and file

metadata.


DataSync supports VPC endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink) in order to move files directly into your Amazon VPC.
