#### CHARGES

With Amazon API Gateway, you only pay when your APIs are in use.

There are no minimum fees or upfront commitments.

You pay only for the API calls you receive, and the amount of data transferred
out.

There are no data transfer out charges for Private APIs (however, AWS
PrivateLink charges apply when using Private APIs

in Amazon API Gateway).

Amazon API Gateway also provides optional data caching charged at an hourly rate
that varies based on the cache size you

select.

The API Gateway free tier includes one million API calls per month for up to 12
months.
