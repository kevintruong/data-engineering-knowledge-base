#### ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND BENEFITS

API Gateway provides several features that assist with creating and managing
APIs:

- **Metering** – Define plans that meter and restrict third-party developer
  access to APIs.

- **Security** – API Gateway provides multiple tools to authorize access to APIs
  and control service operation access.

- **Resiliency** – Manage traffic with throttling so that backend operations can
  withstand traffic spikes.

- **Operations Monitoring** – API Gateway provides a metrics dashboard to
  monitor calls to services.

- **Lifecycle Management** – Operate multiple API versions and multiple stages
  for each version simultaneously so that

  existing applications can continue to call previous versions after new API
  versions are published.

API Gateway provides robust, secure, and scalable access to backend APIs and
hosts multiple versions and release stages

for your APIs.

You can create and distribute API Keys to developers.

Option to use AWS Sig-v4 to authorize access to APIs.

You can throttle and monitor requests to protect your backend.

API Gateway allows you to maintain a cache to store API responses.

SDK Generation for iOS, Android and JavaScript.

Reduced latency and distributed denial of service protection through the use of
CloudFront.

Request/response data transformation and API mocking.

Provides Swagger support.

Resiliency through throttling rules based on the number of requests per second
for each HTTP method (GET, PUT).

Throttling can be configured at multiple levels including Global and Service
Call.

A cache can be created and specified in gigabytes (not enabled by default).

Caches are provisioned for a specific stage of your APIs.

Caching features include customizable keys and time-to-live (TTL) in seconds for
your API data which enhances response

times and reduces load on back-end services.

API Gateway can scale to any level of traffic received by an API.
