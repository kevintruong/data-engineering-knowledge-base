##### Question 14, Answer: 3

**Explanation:**

```

1 is incorrect. To provide low-latency access with Amazon S3 you would need to copy the videos

to buckets in different regions around the world and then create a mechanism for directing

employees to the local copy.

2 is incorrect. AWS Global Accelerator is used for directing users of applications to local points of

presence around the world. It is not used for accessing content in S3, itâ€™s used with ELB and

EC2.

3 is correct. CloudFront is a content delivery network and is ideal for this use case as it caches

the content around the world, provides a single endpoint address, and uses a single source for

the videos.

4 is incorrect. AWS Lambda is a compute service and not suited to this use case.
