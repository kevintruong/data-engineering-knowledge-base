##### Question 10, Answer: 3

**Explanation:**

```

1 is incorrect. The simple routing policy does not perform any routing based on location or

latency.

2 is incorrect. The failover routing policy uses primary and secondary records for high availability.

3 is correct. The latency routing policy directs based on the lowest latency to the AWS resource.

Latency increases over distance so this should ensure customers connect to the closest S3

bucket.

4 is incorrect. The weighted policy uses relative weights not location or latency.
