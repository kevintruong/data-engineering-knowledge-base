##### Question 6, Answer: 3

**Explanation:**

```

1 is incorrect. Network ACLs are applied at the subnet level and will apply to all instances in the

subnet, not just the group of EC2 instances.

2 is incorrect. Operating system-level firewalls require more administrative effort to maintain

and are not the best option on AWS.

3 is correct. A Security Group can be applied to the group of EC2 instances. You can specify what

ports and protocols are allowed to reach the instances and from what sources.

4 is incorrect. An IAM Policy is not a firewall.
