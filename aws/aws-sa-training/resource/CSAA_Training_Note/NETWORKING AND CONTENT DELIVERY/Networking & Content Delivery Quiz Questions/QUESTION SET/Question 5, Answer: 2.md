##### Question 5, Answer: 2

**Explanation:**

```

1 is incorrect. NAT gateways do not have security groups.

2 is correct. By default, new subnets are associated with the default route table. You need to

assign the new route table in order for the instances to see the route to the NAT gateway.

3 is incorrect. You cannot use an Internet Gateway with a private subnet as the instances will not

have public IP addresses.
