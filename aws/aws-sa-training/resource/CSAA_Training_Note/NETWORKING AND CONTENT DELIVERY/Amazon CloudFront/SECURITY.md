#### SECURITY

PCI DSS compliant but recommended not to cache credit card information at edge
locations.

HIPAA compliant as a HIPAA eligible service.

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection:**

- CloudFront distributes traffic across multiple edge locations and filters
  requests to ensure that only valid HTTP(S)

  requests will be forwarded to backend hosts. CloudFront also supports
  geoblocking, which you can use to prevent

  requests from particular geographic locations from being served.
