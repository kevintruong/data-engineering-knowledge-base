#### EXAM TIP: Know the difference between AWS PrivateLink and ClassicLink. ClassicLink allows you to link EC2-Classic

instances to a VPC in your account, within the same region. EC2-Classic is an
old platform from before VPCs were

introduced and is not available to accounts created after December 2013.
However, ClassicLink may come up in exam

questions as a possible (incorrect)

answer so you need to know what it is.
