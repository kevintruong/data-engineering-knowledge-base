#### AWS DIRECT CONNECT

AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated connection from an
on-premises network to Amazon VPC.

Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and
your data center, office, or collocated

environment.

This private connection can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput,
and provide a more consistent network

experience than internet-based connections.

AWS Direct Connect lets you establish 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps dedicated network
connections (or multiple connections) between

AWS networks and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.

It uses industry-standard VLANs to access Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
EC2) instances running within an Amazon

VPC using private IP addresses.

AWS Direct Connect does not encrypt your traffic that is in transit.

You can use the encryption options for the services that traverse AWS Direct
Connect.
