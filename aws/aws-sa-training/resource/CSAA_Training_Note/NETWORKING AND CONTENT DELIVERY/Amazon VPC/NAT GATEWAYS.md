#### NAT GATEWAYS

NAT gateways are managed **for** you by AWS.

Fully-managed NAT service that replaces the need for NAT instances on EC2.

Must be created in a public subnet.

Uses an Elastic IP address for the public IP.

Private instances in private subnets must have a route to the NAT instance,
usually the default route destination of

0.0.0.0/0.

Created in a specified AZ with redundancy in that zone.

For multi-AZ redundancy, create NAT Gateways in each AZ with routes for private
subnets to use the local gateway.

Up to 5 Gbps bandwidth that can scale up to 45 Gbps.

Canâ€™t use a NAT Gateway to access VPC peering, VPN or Direct Connect, so be sure
to include specific routes to those in

your route table.

NAT gateways are highly available in each AZ into which they are deployed.

They are preferred by enterprises.

No need to patch.

Not associated with any security groups.

Automatically assigned a public IP address.

Remember to update route tables and point towards your gateway.

More secure (e.g. you cannot access with SSH and there are no security groups to
maintain).

No need to disable source/destination checks.

Egress only Internet gateways operate on IPv6 whereas NAT gateways operate on
IPv4.

Port forwarding is not supported.

Using the NAT Gateway as a Bastion host server is not supported.

Traffic metrics are not supported.
