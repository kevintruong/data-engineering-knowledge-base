#### AWS DIRECT CONNECT PLUS VPN

With AWS Direct Connect plus VPN, you can combine one or more AWS Direct Connect
dedicated network connections with the

Amazon VPC VPN.

This combination provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection that also
reduces network costs, increases bandwidth

throughput, and provides a more consistent network experience than
internet-based VPN connections.

You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a dedicated network connection
between your network create a logical

connection to public AWS resources, such as an Amazon virtual private gateway
IPsec endpoint.

This solution combines the AWS managed benefits of the VPN solution with low
latency, increased bandwidth, more

consistent benefits of the AWS Direct Connect solution, and an end-to-end,
secure IPsec connection.
