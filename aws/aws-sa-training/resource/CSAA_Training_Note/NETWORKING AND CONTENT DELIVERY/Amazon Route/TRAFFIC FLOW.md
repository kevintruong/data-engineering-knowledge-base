#### TRAFFIC FLOW


Route 53 Traffic Flow provides Global Traffic Management (GTM) services.


Traffic flow policies allow you to create routing configurations for resources using routing types such as failover and

geolocation.


Create policies that route traffic based on specific constraints, including latency, endpoint health, load,

geo-proximity and geography.


**Scenarios include:**


- Adding a simple backup page in Amazon S3 for a website.

- Building sophisticated routing policies that consider an end userâ€™s geographic location, proximity to an AWS region,

  and the health of each of your endpoints.


Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow also includes a versioning feature that allows you to maintain a history of changes to your

routing policies, and easily roll back to a previous policy version using the console or API.
