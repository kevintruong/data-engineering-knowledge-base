#### FILE GATEWAY

File gateway provides a virtual on-premises file server, which enables you to
store and retrieve files as objects in

Amazon S3.

Can be used for on-premises applications, and for Amazon EC2-resident
applications that need file storage in S3 for

object-based workloads.

Used for flat files only, stored directly on S3.

File gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local
caching.

File gateway supports Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (S3
Standard – IA) and S3 One Zone – IA.

File gateway supports clients connecting to the gateway using NFS v3 and v4.1.

Microsoft Windows clients that support NFS v3 can connect to file gateway.

The maximum size of an individual file is 5 TB.
