#### AMAZON FSX FOR WINDOWS FILE SERVER

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides a fully managed native Microsoft
Windows file system so you can easily move

your Windows-based applications that require shared file storage to AWS.

Built on Windows Server, Amazon FSx provides the compatibility and features that
your Microsoft applications rely on,

including full support for the SMB protocol, Windows NTFS, and Microsoft

Active Directory (AD) integration.

Amazon FSx uses SSD storage to provide fast performance with low latency.

This compatibility, performance, and scalability enables business-critical
workloads such as home directories, media

workflows, and business applications.

Amazon FSx helps you optimize TCO with Data Deduplication, reducing costs by 50
- 60% for general- purpose file shares.

User quotas give you the option to better monitor and control costs. You pay for
only the resources used, with no

upfront costs, or licensing fees.

**Details and Benefits**

**High availability:** Amazon FSx automatically replicates your data within an
Availability Zone (AZ) it resides in (

which you specify during creation) to protect it from component failure,
continuously monitors for hardware failures,

and automatically replaces infrastructure components in the event of a failure.

**Multi-AZ:** Amazon FSx offers a multiple availability (AZ) deployment option,
designed to provide continuous

availability to data, even in the event that an AZ is unavailable. Multi-AZ file
systems include an active and standby

file server in separate AZs, and any changes written to disk in your file system
are synchronously replicated across AZs

to the standby.

**Supports Windows-native file system features:**

- Access Control Lists (ACLs), shadow copies, and user quotas.

- NTFS file systems that can be accessed from up to thousands of compute
  instances using the SMB protocol.

Works with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to easily integrate file systems with
Windows environments.

Built on SSD-storage, Amazon FSx provides fast performance with up to 2
GB/second throughput per file system, hundreds

of thousands of IOPS, and consistent sub-millisecond latencies.

Can choose a throughput level that is independent of your file system size.

Using DFS Namespaces, you can scale performance up to tens of gigabytes per
second of throughput, with millions of IOPS,

across hundreds of petabytes of data.

Amazon FSx can connect file systems to Amazon EC2, VMware Cloud on AWS, Amazon
WorkSpaces, and Amazon AppStream 2.0

instances.

Amazon FSx also supports on-premises access via AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN,
and access from multiple VPCs, accounts,

and regions using VPC Peering or AWS Transit Gateway.

Amazon FSx automatically encrypts your data at-rest and in-transit.

Assessed to comply with ISO, PCI-DSS, and SOC certifications, and is HIPAA
eligible.

Integration with AWS CloudTrail monitors and logs your API calls letting you see
actions taken by users on Amazon FSx

resources.

Pay only for the resources you use, with no minimum commitments or up-front
fees.

Can optimize costs by removing redundant data with Data Deduplication.

User quotas provide tracking, monitoring, and enforcing of storage consumption
to help reduce costs.
