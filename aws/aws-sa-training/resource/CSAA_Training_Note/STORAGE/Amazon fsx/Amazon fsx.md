### Amazon fsx


Amazon FSx provides fully managed third-party file systems.


Amazon FSx provides you with the native compatibility of third-party file systems with feature sets for workloads such

as Windows-based storage, high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, and electronic design automation (EDA).


You donâ€™t have to worry about managing file servers and storage, as Amazon FSx automates the time-consuming

administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, software configuration, patching, and backups.


Amazon FSx integrates the file systems with cloud-native AWS services, making them even more useful for a broader set of

workloads.


**Amazon FSx provides you with two file systems to choose from:**


- Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for Windows-based applications

- Amazon FSx for Lustre for compute-intensive workloads.
