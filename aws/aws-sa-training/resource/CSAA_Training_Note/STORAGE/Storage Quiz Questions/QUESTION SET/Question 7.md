##### Question 7


A US based organization is concerned about uploading data to Amazon S3 as data sovereignty rules mean they


cannot move their data outside of the US. What would you tell them?


1. Data never leaves a region unless specifically configured to do so.

2. Data will be replicated globally so they cannot use Amazon S3.
