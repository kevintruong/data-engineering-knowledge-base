##### Question 10, Answer: 4


**Explanation:**


```

1 is incorrect. IAM can be used to control who can administer the file system but not control the

access to files and directories.

2 is incorrect. EFS security groups control network traffic that is allowed to reach the filesystem.

3 is incorrect. Network ACLs are not used for file and directory permissions, they restrict traffic

into and out of subnets.

4 is correct. You can control access to files and directories with POSIX-compliant user and group-

level permissions.
