#### STORAGE CLASSES


**There are six S3 storage classes.**


- S3 Standard (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed).

- S3 Intelligent-Tiering (automatically moves data to the most cost-effective tier).

- S3 Standard-IA (durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed).

- S3 One Zone-IA (lower cost for infrequently accessed data with less resilience).

- S3 Glacier (archived data, retrieval times in minutes or hours).

- S3 Glacier Deep Archive (lowest cost storage class for long term retention).


The table below provides the details of each Amazon S3 storage class:
