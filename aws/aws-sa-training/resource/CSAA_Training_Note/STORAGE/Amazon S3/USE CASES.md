#### USE CASES


**Typical use cases include:**


- Backup and Storage – Provide data backup and storage services for others.

- Application Hosting – Provide services that deploy, install, and manage web applications.

- Media Hosting – Build a redundant, scalable, and highly available infrastructure that hosts video, photo, or music

  uploads and downloads.



- Software Delivery – Host your software applications that customers can download.

- Static Website – you can configure a static website to run from an S3 bucket.


S3 is a persistent, highly durable data store.


Persistent data stores are non-volatile storage systems that retain data when powered off.


This is in contrast to transient data stores and ephemeral data stores which lose the data when powered off.


The following table provides a description of persistent, transient and ephemeral data stores and which AWS service to
