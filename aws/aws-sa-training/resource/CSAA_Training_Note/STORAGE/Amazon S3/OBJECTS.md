#### OBJECTS


Each object is stored and retrieved by a unique key (ID or name).


**An object in S3 is uniquely identified and addressed through:**


- Service end-point.

- Bucket name.

- Object key (name).

- Optionally, an object version.


Objects stored in a bucket will never leave the region in which they are stored unless you move them to another region

or enable cross-region replication.


You can define permissions on objects when uploading and at any time afterwards using the AWS Management Console.
