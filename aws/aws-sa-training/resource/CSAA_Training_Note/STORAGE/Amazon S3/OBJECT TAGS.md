#### OBJECT TAGS


S3 object tags are key-value pairs applied to S3 objects which can be created, updated or deleted at


any time during the lifetime of the object.


Allow you to create Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, setup S3 Lifecycle policies, and customize storage

metrics.


Up to ten tags can be added to each S3 object and you can use either the AWS Management Console, the REST API, the AWS

CLI, or the AWS SDKs to add object tags.
