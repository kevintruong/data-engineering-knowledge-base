#### EFS ENCRYPTION

EFS offers the ability to encrypt data at rest and in transit.

Encryption keys are managed by the AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

Data encryption in transit uses industry standard Transport Layer Security (TLS)
1.2 to encrypt data sent between your

clients and EFS file systems.

Data encrypted at rest is transparently encrypted while being written, and
transparently decrypted while being read.

Enable encryption at rest in the EFS console or by using the AWS CLI or SDKs.

Encryption of data at rest and of data in transit can be configured together or
separately to help meet your unique

security requirements.
