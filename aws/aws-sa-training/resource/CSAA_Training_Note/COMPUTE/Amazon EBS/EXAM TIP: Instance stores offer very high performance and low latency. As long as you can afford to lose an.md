#### EXAM TIP: Instance stores offer very high performance and low latency. As long as you can afford to lose an

instance, i.e. you are replicating your data, these can be a good solution for
high performance/low latency

requirements. Look out for questions that mention distributed or replicated
databases that need high I/O. Also, remember

that the cost of instance stores is included in the instance charges so it can
also be more cost-effective than EBS

Provisioned IOPS.
