### AWS Elastic Beanstalk


AWS Elastic Beanstalk can be used to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud.


Developers upload applications and Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load

balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.


AWS Elastic Beanstalk leverages Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling to automatically scale your application in and

out based on your application’s specific needs.


In addition, multiple availability zones give you an option to improve application reliability and availability by

running in more than one zone.
