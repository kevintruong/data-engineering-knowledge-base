##### Question 5, Answer: 3


**Explanation:**


```

1 is incorrect. EBS volumes are persistent. You can get high performance, but they are network

attached disks, not local disks.

2 is incorrect. Snapshots are used for taking a backup of EBS volumes.

3 is correct. Instance store volumes are ephemeral (non-persistent) local disks that offer very

high performance.

4 is incorrect. Amazon S3 is an object storage system. It is not a local disk nor is it non-persistent.
