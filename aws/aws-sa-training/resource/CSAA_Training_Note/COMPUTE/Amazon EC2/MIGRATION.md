#### MIGRATION


AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) is an agent-less service which makes it easier and faster for you to migrate

thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS.


AWS SMS allows you to automate, schedule, and track incremental replications of live server volumes, making it easier

for you to coordinate large-scale server migrations.


Automates migration of on-premises VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V/SCVMM virtual machines to AWS.


Replicates VMs to AWS, syncing volumes and creating periodic AMIs.


Minimizes cutover downtime by syncing VMs incrementally.


Supports Windows and Linux VMs only (just like AWS).


The Server Migration Connector is downloaded as a virtual appliance into your on-premises vSphere or Hyper-V

environments.
