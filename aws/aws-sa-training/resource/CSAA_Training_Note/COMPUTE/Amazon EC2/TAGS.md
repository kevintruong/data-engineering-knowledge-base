#### TAGS

A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource.

Used to manage AWS assets.

Tags are just arbitrary name/value pairs that you can assign to virtually all
AWS assets to serve as metadata.

Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

Tagging strategies can be used for cost allocation, security, automation, and
many other uses. For example, you can use

a tag in an IAM policy to implement access control.

Enforcing standardized tagging can be done via AWS Config rules or custom
scripts. For example, EC2 instances not

properly tagged are stopped or terminated daily.

Most resources can have up to 50 tags.
