#### ECS CONTAINER AGENT

The ECS container agent allows container instances to connect to the cluster.

The container agent runs on each infrastructure resource on an ECS cluster.

The ECS container agent is included in the Amazon ECS optimized AMI and can also
be installed on any EC2 instance that

supports the ECS specification (only supported on EC2 instances).

Linux and Windows based.

For non-AWS Linux instances to be used on AWS you must manually install the ECS
container agent.
