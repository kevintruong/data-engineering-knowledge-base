#### FULL FEATURE API


AWS WAF can be completely administered via APIs.


This provides organizations with the ability to create and maintain rules automatically and incorporate them into the

development and design process.


For example, a developer who has detailed knowledge of the web application could create a security rule as part of the

deployment process.


This capability to incorporate security into your development process avoids the need for complex handoffs between

application and security teams to make sure rules are kept up to date.


AWS WAF can also be deployed and provisioned automatically with AWS CloudFormation sample templates that allow you to

describe all security rules you would like to deploy for your web


applications delivered by Amazon CloudFront.


AWS WAF is integrated with Amazon CloudFront, which supports custom origins outside of AWS â€“ this means you can protect

web sites not hosted in AWS.


Support for IPv6 allows the AWS WAF to inspect HTTP/S requests coming from both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.
