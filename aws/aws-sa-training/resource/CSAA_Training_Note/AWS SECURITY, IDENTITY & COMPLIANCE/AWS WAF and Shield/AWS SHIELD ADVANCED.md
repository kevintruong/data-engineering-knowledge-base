#### AWS SHIELD ADVANCED


Provides higher levels of protection against attacks targeting applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (

EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon Route 53 resources.


In addition to the network and transport layer protections that come with Standard, AWS Shield Advanced provides

additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility into

attacks, and integration with AWS WAF, a web application firewall.


AWS Shield Advanced also gives you 24Ã—7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and protection against DDoS related

spikes in your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load


Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon Route 53 charges.


AWS Shield Advanced is available globally on all Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 edge

locations.


Origin servers can be Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), or a custom server

outside of AWS.


AWS Shield Advanced includes DDoS cost protection, a safeguard from scaling charges as a result of a DDoS attack that

causes usage spikes on protected Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, or

Amazon Route 53.


If any of the AWS Shield Advanced protected resources scale up in response to a DDoS attack, you can request credits via

the regular AWS Support channel.
