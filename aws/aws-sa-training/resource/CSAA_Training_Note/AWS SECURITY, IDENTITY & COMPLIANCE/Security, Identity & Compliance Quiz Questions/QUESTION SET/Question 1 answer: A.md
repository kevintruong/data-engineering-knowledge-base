##### Question 1 answer: A

Explanation:

```

A security principle is an individual identity such as a user account within a directory. The AWS

Directory service includes: Active Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, Simple AD, AD

Connector. One of these services may be ideal depending on detailed requirements. The Active

Directory Service for Microsoft AD and AD Connector both require a VPN or Direct Connect

connection.

A VPN with NACLs and security groups will not deliver the required solution. AWS Directory

Service with IAM or EC2 with IAM are also not sufficient for leveraging on-premise security

principles. You must have a VPN.
