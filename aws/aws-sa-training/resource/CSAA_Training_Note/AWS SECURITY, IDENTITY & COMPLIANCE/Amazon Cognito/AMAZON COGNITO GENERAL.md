#### AMAZON COGNITO GENERAL


Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily.


Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps.


Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, or

Google.


**The two main components of AWS Cognito are user pools and identity pools:**


- User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users.

- Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services.


You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.


AWS Cognito works with external identity providers that support SAML or OpenID Connect, social identity providers (such

as Facebook, Twitter, Amazon).


Cognito Identity provides temporary security credentials to access your appâ€™s backend resources in AWS or any service

behind Amazon API Gateway.


You can use Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Digits, Google and any other OpenID Connect compatible identity provider.


You can also integrate your own identity provider.


Cognito exposes server-side APIs.


Users can sign-up and sign-in using email, phone number, or user name.


End users of an application can also sign in with SMS-based MFA.


There is an import tool for migrating users into an Amazon Cognito User Pool.
