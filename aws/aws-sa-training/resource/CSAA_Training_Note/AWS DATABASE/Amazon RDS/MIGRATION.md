#### MIGRATION


AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely.


Use along with the Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to migrate databases to AWS RDS or EC2-based databases.


The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the

database.


The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source

databases.


Schema Conversion Tool can copy database schemas for homogenous migrations (same database)

and convert schemas for heterogeneous migrations (different database).


DMS is used for smaller, simpler conversions and also supports MongoDB and DynamoDB.


SCT is used for larger, more complex datasets like data warehouses.


DMS has replication functions for on-premise to AWS or to Snowball or S3.
