#### AURORA SERVERLESS

Amazon Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon
Aurora.

Available for MySQL-compatible and PostgreSQL-compatible editions.

The database automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales capacity up or down
based on

application needs.

It enables you to run a database in the cloud without managing any database
instances. It's a simple, cost-effective

option for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads.

You simply create a database endpoint and optionally specify the desired
database capacity range and connect

applications.

With Aurora Serverless, you only pay for database storage and the database
capacity and I/O your database consumes while

it is active.

Pay on a per-second basis for the database capacity you use when the database is
active.

Can migrate between standard and serverless configurations with a few clicks in
the Amazon RDS Management Console.
