#### CROSS-REGION READ REPLICAS


Cross-region read replicas allow you to improve your disaster recovery posture, scale read operations in regions closer

to your application users, and easily migrate from one region to another.


Cross-region replicas provide fast local reads to your users.


Each region can have an additional 15 Aurora replicas to further scale local reads.


You can choose between Global Database, which provides the best replication performance, and traditional binlog-based

replication.


You can also set up your own binlog replication with external MySQL databases.
