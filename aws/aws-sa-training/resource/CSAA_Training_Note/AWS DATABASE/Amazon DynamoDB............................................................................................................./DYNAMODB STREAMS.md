#### DYNAMODB STREAMS

DynamoDB Streams help you to keep a list of item level changes or provide a list
of item level changes that have taken

place in the last 24hrs.

Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can create
triggersâ€”pieces of code that automatically respond

to events in DynamoDB Streams.

If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream ARN with
a Lambda function that you write.
