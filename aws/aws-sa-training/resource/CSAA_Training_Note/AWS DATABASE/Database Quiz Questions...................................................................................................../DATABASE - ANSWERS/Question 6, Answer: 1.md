##### Question 6, Answer: 1


**Explanation:**


```

1 is correct. DynamoDB is a schema-less NoSQL database that provides push-button scaling.

2 is incorrect. ElastiCache is an in-memory relational database so it is not schema-less.

3 is incorrect. Amazon RDS is a relational database (not schema-less) and uses EC2 instances so

does not offer push-button scaling.

4 is incorrect. Amazon Aurora is a relational database (not schema-less) and uses EC2 instances

so does not offer push-button scaling.
