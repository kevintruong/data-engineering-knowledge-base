**Explanation:**

Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. Firehose

Destinations include: Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk.

Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data

using standard SQL and existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

RDS is a transactional database and is not a supported Kinesis Firehose destination.

- ✅ :  "Kinesis Firehose with RedShift" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "EMR using Hive" is incorrect. EMR is a hosted Hadoop framework and doesn’t natively support SQL.

- ❌ :  "Kinesis Firehose with RDS" is incorrect as RedShift is a better solution for an analytics use case.

- ❌ :  "EMR running Apache Spark" is incorrect. EMR is a hosted Hadoop framework and doesn’t natively support SQL.
