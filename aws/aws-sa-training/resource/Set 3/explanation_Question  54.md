**Explanation:**

Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that makes it simple and cost- effective

to efficiently analyze all your data using your existing business intelligence tools. It is optimized for datasets

ranging from a few hundred gigabytes to a petabyte or more. Amazon RedShift uses columnar storage.

- ✅ :  "Amazon RedShift" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Amazon DynamoDB" is incorrect. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service, it is not a

  columnar database.

- ❌ :  "Amazon RDS" is incorrect. Amazon RDS is more suited to OLTP workloads rather than analytics workloads.

- ❌ :  "Amazon ElastiCache" is incorrect. Amazon ElastiCache is an in-memory caching service.
