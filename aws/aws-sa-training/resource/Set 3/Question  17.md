#### Question  17


**A solutions architect is designing a microservices architecture. AWS Lambda will store data in an Amazon DynamoDB

table named Orders. The solutions architect needs to apply an IAM policy to the Lambda functionâ€™s execution role to

allow it to put, update, and delete items in the Orders table. No other actions should be allowed.**


**Which of the following code snippets should be included in the IAM policy to fulfill this requirement whilst providing

the LEAST privileged access?**


1:


```json5

{

  "Sid": "PutUpdateDeleteOnOrders",

  "Effect": "Allow",

  "Action": [

    "dynamodb:PutItem",

    "dynamodb:UpdateItem",

    "dynamodb:DeleteItem"

  ],

  "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:227392126428:table/Orders"

}

```


2:


```json5

{

  "Sid": "PutUpdateDeleteOnOrders",

  "Effect": "Allow",

  "Action": [

    "dynamodb:PutItem",

    "dynamodb:UpdateItem",

    "dynamodb:DeleteItem"

  ],

  "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:227392126428:table/*"

}       

```


3:


```json5

{

  "Sid": "PutUpdateDeleteOnOrders",

  "Effect": "Allow",

  "Action": "dynamodb:* ",

  "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:227392126428:table/Orders"

}       

```


4:


```json5

{

  "Sid": "PutUpdateDeleteOnOrders",

  "Effect": "Deny",

  "Action": "dynamodb:* ",

  "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:227392126428:table/Orders"

}

```
