**Explanation:**

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps detect and block malicious web requests targeted at your web

applications. AWS WAF allows you to create rules that can help protect against common web exploits like SQL injection

and cross-site scripting. With AWS WAF you first identify the resource (either an Amazon

CloudFront distribution or an Application Load Balancer) that you need to protect. You then deploy the rules and filters

that will best protect your applications.

The other services listed do not enable you to create custom web security rules that can block known malicious attacks.
