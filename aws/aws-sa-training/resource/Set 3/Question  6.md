#### Question  6


**An online store uses an Amazon Aurora database. The database is deployed as a Multi-AZ deployment. Recently, metrics

have shown that database read requests are high and causing performance issues which result in latency for write

requests.**


**What should the solutions architect do to separate the read requests from the write requests?**


- [ ] Enable read through caching on the Amazon Aurora database


- [x] Update the application to read from the Multi-AZ standby instance


- [ ] Create a read replica and modify the application to use the appropriate endpoint


- [ ] Create a second Amazon Aurora database and link it to the primary database as a read replica
