**Explanation:**

Amazon FSx for Lustre provides a high-performance file system optimized for fast processing of workloads such as machine

learning, high performance computing (HPC), video processing, financial modeling, and electronic design automation (EDA)

. Amazon FSx works natively with Amazon S3, letting you transparently access your S3 objects as files on Amazon FSx to

run analyses for hours to months.
