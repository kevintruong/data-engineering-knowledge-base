#### Question  12

**A company runs a financial application using an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (

ALB). When running month-end reports on a specific day and time each month the application becomes unacceptably slow.

Amazon CloudWatch metrics show the CPU utilization hitting 100%.**

**What should a solutions architect recommend to ensure the application is able to handle the workload and avoid

downtime?**

- [ ] :  Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the ALB

- [ ] :  Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling simple scaling policy based on CPU utilization

- [x] :  Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling scheduled scaling policy based on the monthly schedule

- [ ] :  Configure Amazon ElastiCache to remove some of the workload from the EC2 instances
