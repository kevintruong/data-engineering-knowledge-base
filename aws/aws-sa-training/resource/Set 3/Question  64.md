#### Question  64


**You are planning to deploy a number of EC2 instances in your VPC. The EC2 instances will be deployed across several

subnets and multiple AZs. What AWS feature can act as an instance-level firewall to control traffic between your EC2

instances?**


1: AWS WAF


2: Security group


3: Route table


4: Network ACL


Answer: 2


**Explanation:**


A _security group_ acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch

an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance

level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of

security groups.


- CORRECT "Security group" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "AWS WAF" is incorrect. AWS WAF is a web application firewall and does not work at the instance level.


- INCORRECT "Route table" is incorrect. Route tables are not firewalls.


- INCORRECT "Network ACL" is incorrect. Network ACLâ€™s function at the subnet level.
