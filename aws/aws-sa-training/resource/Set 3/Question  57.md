#### Question  57


**You are developing an application that uses Lambda functions. You need to store some sensitive data that includes

credentials for accessing the database tier. You are planning to store this data as environment variables within Lambda.

How can you ensure this sensitive information is properly secured?**


- [ ] This cannot be done, only the environment variables that relate to the Lambda function itself can be encrypted


- [x] Use encryption helpers that leverage AWS Key Management Service to store the sensitive information as Ciphertext


- [ ] There is no need to make any changes as all environment variables are encrypted by default with AWS Lambda


- [ ] Store the environment variables in an encrypted DynamoDB table and configure Lambda to retrieve them as required
