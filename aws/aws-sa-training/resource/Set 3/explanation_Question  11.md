**Explanation:**

This question is simply asking you to work out the best compute service for the stated requirements. The key

requirements are that the compute service should be suitable for a workload that can range quite broadly in demand from

no requests to large bursts of traffic.

AWS Lambda is an ideal solution as you pay only when requests are made and it can easily scale to accommodate the large

bursts in traffic. Lambda works well with both API Gateway and Amazon RDS.

- ✅ :  "Set up an Amazon API Gateway and use AWS Lambda functions" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Set up an Amazon API Gateway and use Amazon ECS" is incorrect

- ❌ :  "Set up an Amazon API Gateway and use AWS Elastic Beanstalk" is incorrect

- ❌ :  "Set up an Amazon API Gateway and use Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling" is incorrect
