#### Question  9

**A security team wants to limit access to specific services or actions in all of the team's AWS accounts. All accounts

belong to a large organization in AWS Organizations. The solution must be scalable and there must be a single point

where permissions can be maintained.**

**What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?**

- [ ] Create an ACL to provide access to the services or actions

- [ ] Create a security group to allow accounts and attach it to user groups

- [ ] Create cross-account roles in each account to deny access to the services or actions

- [x] Create a service control policy in the root organizational unit to deny access to the services or actions
