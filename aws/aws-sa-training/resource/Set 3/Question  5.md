#### Question  5


**A production application runs on an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. A solutions architect is building a new reporting

tool that will access the same data. The reporting tool must be highly available and not impact the performance of the

production application.**


**How can this be achieved?**


- [ ] Create a cross-region Multi-AZ deployment and create a read replica in the second region


- [x] Create a Multi-AZ RDS Read Replica of the production RDS DB instance


- [ ] Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to automatically create and manage snapshots


- [ ] Create a Single-AZ RDS Read Replica of the production RDS DB instance. Create a second Single-AZ RDS Read Replica

from the replica
