#### Question  61


**A Solutions Architect is designing a web page for event registrations and needs a managed service to send a text

message to users every time users sign up for an event.**


**Which AWS service should the Architect use to achieve this?**


1: Amazon STS


2: Amazon SQS


3: AWS Lambda


4: Amazon SNS


Answer: 4


**Explanation:**


Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications

from the cloud and supports notifications over multiple transports including HTTP/HTTPS, Email/Email-JSON, SQS and SMS.


- CORRECT "Amazon SNS" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Amazon STS" is incorrect. Amazon Security Token Service (STS) is used for requesting temporary credentials.


- INCORRECT "Amazon SQS" is incorrect. Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a message queue used for decoupling

  application components.


- INCORRECT "AWS Lambda" is incorrect. Lambda is a serverless service that runs code in response to events/triggers.
