#### Question  31


**An e-commerce web application needs a highly scalable key-value database. Which AWS database service should be used?**


1: Amazon RDS


2: Amazon RedShift


3: Amazon DynamoDB


4: Amazon ElastiCache


Answer: 3


**Explanation:**


A key-value database is a type of nonrelational (NoSQL) database that uses a simple key-value method to store data. A

key-value database stores data as a collection of key-value pairs in which a key serves as a unique identifier. Amazon

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless

scalability â€“ this is the best database for these requirements.


- CORRECT "Amazon DynamoDB" is the correct answer.


- INCORRECT "Amazon RDS" is incorrect. Amazon RDS is a relational (SQL) type of database, not a key-value /

  nonrelational database.


- INCORRECT "Amazon RedShift" is incorrect. Amazon RedShift is a data warehouse service used for online analytics

  processing (OLAP) workloads.


- INCORRECT "Amazon ElastiCache" is incorrect. Amazon ElastiCache is an in-memory caching database. This is not a

  nonrelational key-value database.
