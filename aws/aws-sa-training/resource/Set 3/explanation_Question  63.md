**Explanation:**

You can specify one of the following when initiating a job to retrieve an archive based on your access time and cost

requirements.

- **Expedited —** Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data when occasional urgent requests for a

  subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archives (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals

  are typically made available within 1– 5 minutes. Provisioned Capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited

  retrievals is available when you need it.

- **Standard —** Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archives within several hours. Standard retrievals

  typically complete within 3–5 hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the

  retrieval option.

- **Bulk —** Bulk retrievals are S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, which you can use to retrieve large amounts,

  even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5–12 hours.

- ✅ :  "Expedited retrieval" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Standard retrieval" is incorrect. Standard retrievals typically complete in 3-5 hours.

- ❌ :  "Bulk retrieval" is incorrect. Bulk retrievals allow cost-effective access to significant amounts of data in

  5-12 hours.

- ❌ :  "Vault Lock" is incorrect. Vault Lock allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls on

  individual Glacier vaults via a lockable policy (Vault Lock policy).
