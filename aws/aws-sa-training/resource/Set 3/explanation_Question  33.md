**Explanation:**

Throughput Optimized HDD is the most cost-effective storage option and for a small DB with low traffic volumes it may be

sufficient. Note that the volume must be at least 500 GB in size.

A breakdown of EBS volume types is provided below:

- ✅ :  "Amazon EBS Throughput Optimized HDD" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD" is incorrect.. Provisioned IOPS SSD provides high performance but at a

  higher cost.

- ❌ :  Amazon EFS"" is incorrect. The Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is not an ideal storage solution for a

  database.

- ❌ :  "Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD" is incorrect. AWS recommend using General Purpose SSD rather than

  Throughput Optimized HDD for most use cases but it is more expensive.
