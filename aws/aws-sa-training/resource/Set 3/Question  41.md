#### Question  41


**A Kinesis consumer application is reading at a slower rate than expected. It has been identified that multiple

consumer applications have total reads exceeding the per-shard limits. How can this situation be resolved?**


- [x] Increase the number of shards in the Kinesis data stream


- [ ] Implement API throttling to restrict the number of requests per-shard


- [ ] Increase the number of read transactions per shard


- [ ] Implement read throttling for the Kinesis data stream
