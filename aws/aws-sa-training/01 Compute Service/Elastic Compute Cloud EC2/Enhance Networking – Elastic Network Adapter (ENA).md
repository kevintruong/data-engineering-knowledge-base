### Enhance Networking â€“ Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)

<!-- #ena #elastic_network_adapter -->

Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet-per-second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies.

Enhanced networking is enabled using an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA).

If your packets-per-second rate appears to have reached its ceiling, you should consider moving to enhanced networking because you have likely reached the upper thresholds of the VIF driver.

AWS currently supports enhanced networking capabilities using SR-IOV.

SR-IOV provides direct access to network adapters, provides higher performance (packets-per- second) and lower latency.

Must launch an HVM AMI with the appropriate drivers.

Only available for certain instance types.

Only supported in VPC.
