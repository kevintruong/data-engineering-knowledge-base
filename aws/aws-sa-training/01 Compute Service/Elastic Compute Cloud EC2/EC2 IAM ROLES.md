### **EC2 IAM ROLES**

<!-- #ec2_iam -->

IAM roles are more secure than storing access keys and secret access keys on EC2 instances.

IAM roles are easier to manage.

You can attach an IAM role to an instance at launch time or at any time after by using the AWS CLI, SDK, or the EC2 console.

IAM roles can be attached, modified, or replaced at any time.

Only one IAM role can be attached to an EC2 instance at a time.

IAM roles are universal and can be used in any region.
