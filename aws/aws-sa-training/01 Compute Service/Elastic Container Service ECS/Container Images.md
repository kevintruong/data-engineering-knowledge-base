### **Container Images**

Containers are created from a read-only template called an image which has the instructions for creating a Docker container.

Images are built from a Dockerfile.

Only Docker containers are currently supported.

An image contains the instructions for creating a Docker container.

Images are stored in a registry such as DockerHub or [[AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)]].
