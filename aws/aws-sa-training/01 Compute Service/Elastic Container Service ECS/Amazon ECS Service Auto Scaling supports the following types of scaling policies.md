### Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling  scaling policies types:

- Target Tracking Scaling Policies—Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs based on a target value for a specific CloudWatch metric. This is similar to the way that your thermostat maintains the temperature of your home. You select temperature and the thermostat does the rest.
- Step Scaling Policies—Increase or decrease the number of tasks that your service runs in response to CloudWatch alarms. Step scaling is based on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments, which vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
