### Security and SLA

EC2 instances use an IAM role to access ECS.

IAM can be used to control access at the container level using IAM roles.

The container agent makes calls to the ECS API on your behalf through the applied IAM roles and policies.

You need to apply IAM roles to container instances before they are launched (EC2 launch type).

AWS recommend limiting the permissions that are assigned to the container instanceâ€™s IAM roles.

Assign extra permissions to tasks through separate IAM roles (IAM Roles for Tasks).

ECS tasks use an IAM role to access services and resources.

Security groups attach at the instance or container level.

You have root level access to the operating system of the EC2 instances.

The Compute SLA guarantees a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.99% for Amazon ECS.
