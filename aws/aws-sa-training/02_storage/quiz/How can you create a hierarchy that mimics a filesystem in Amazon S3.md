### **How can you create a hierarchy that mimics a filesystem in Amazon S3?**

- [x] Use folders in your buckets
- [ ] Upload objects within other objects
- [ ] Use lifecycle rules to tier your data

---- 
**Answer: 2**

**Explanation:**

- Create buckets within other buckets is incorrect. You cannot nest buckets (create buckets inside other buckets).
- Use folders in your buckets is correct. You can mimic the hierarchy of a filesystem by creating folder in your buckets.
- Upload objects within other objects is incorrect. You cannot upload objects within other objects.
- Use lifecycle rules to tier your data is incorrect. Tiering your data is done for performance not to mimic a filesystem.
