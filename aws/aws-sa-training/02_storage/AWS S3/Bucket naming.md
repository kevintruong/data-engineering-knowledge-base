### **Bucket naming:**

- Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 character in length.
- Bucket names must start and end with a lowercase character or a number.
- Bucket names must be a series of one or more labels which are separated by a period.
- Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.
- Bucket names cannot be formatted as an IP address.

For better performance, lower latency, and lower cost, create the bucket closer to your clients.
