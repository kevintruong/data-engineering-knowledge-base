#### PRICING


With Amazon Athena, you pay only for the queries that you run.


You are charged based on the amount of data scanned by each query.


You can get significant cost savings and performance gains by compressing,

partitioning, or converting your data to a columnar format, because each of

those operations reduces the amount of data that Athena needs to scan to execute

a query.
