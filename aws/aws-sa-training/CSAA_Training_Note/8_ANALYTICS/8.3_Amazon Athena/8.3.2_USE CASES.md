#### USE CASES


Query services like Amazon Athena, data warehouses like Amazon Redshift, and

sophisticated data processing frameworks like Amazon EMR, all address different

needs and use cases.


Amazon Redshift provides the fastest query performance for enterprise reporting

and business intelligence workloads, particularly those involving extremely

complex SQL with multiple joins and sub-queries.


Amazon EMR makes it simple and cost effective to run highly distributed

processing frameworks


such as Hadoop, Spark, and Presto when compared to on-premises deployments.

Amazon EMR is flexible â€“ you can run custom applications and code, and define

specific compute, memory, storage, and application parameters to optimize your

analytic requirements.


Amazon Athena provides the easiest way to run ad-hoc queries for data in S3

without the need to setup or manage any servers.
