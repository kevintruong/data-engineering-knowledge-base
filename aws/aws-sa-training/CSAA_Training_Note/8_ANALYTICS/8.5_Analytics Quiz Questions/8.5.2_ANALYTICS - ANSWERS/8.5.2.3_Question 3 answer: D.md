Kinesis Data Streams enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming

data for specialized needs. It enables real-time processing of streaming big data and can be used

for rapidly moving data off data producers and then continuously processing the data. Kinesis

Data Streams stores data for later processing by applications (key difference with Firehose which

delivers data directly to AWS services).

Kinesis Firehose can allow transformation of data and it then delivers data to supported services.

RedShift is a data warehouse solution used for analyzing data.

EMR is a hosted Hadoop framework that is used for analytics.
