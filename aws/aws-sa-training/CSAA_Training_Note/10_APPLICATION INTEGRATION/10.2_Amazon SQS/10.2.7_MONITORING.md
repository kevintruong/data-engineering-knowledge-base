#### MONITORING


CloudWatch is integrated with SQS and you can view and monitor queue metrics.


CloudWatch metrics are automatically collected every 5 minutes.


CloudWatch considers a queue to be active for up to 6 hours if it contains any

messages or if any API action accesses it.


No charge for CloudWatch (no detailed monitoring).


CloudTrail captures API calls from SQS and logs to a specified S3 bucket.
