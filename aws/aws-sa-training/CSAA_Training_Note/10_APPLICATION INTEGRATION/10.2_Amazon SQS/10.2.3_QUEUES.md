#### QUEUES


Queue names must be unique within a region.


Queues can be either standard or first-in-first-out (FIFO).


Standard queues provide a loose-FIFO capability that attempts to preserve the

order of messages.


Because standard queues are designed to be massively scalable using a highly

distributed architecture, receiving messages in the exact order they are sent is

not guaranteed.


Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is

delivered at least once.


FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues preserve the exact order in which messages are

sent and received.


If you use a FIFO queue, you donâ€™t have to place sequencing information in your

message.


FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is

delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes

it.
