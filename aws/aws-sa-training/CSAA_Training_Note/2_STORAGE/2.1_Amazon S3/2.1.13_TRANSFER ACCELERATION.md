#### TRANSFER ACCELERATION


Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of

files over long distances between your client and your Amazon S3 bucket.


S3 Transfer Acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed AWS

Edge Locations.

Transfer acceleration is as secure as a direct upload to S3.


You are charged only if there was a benefit in transfer times.

Cannot be disabled, can only be suspended.


May take up to 30 minutes to implement.


URL is: <bucketname>.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com.

Now HIPAA compliant.


You can use multipart uploads with transfer acceleration.


**Must use one of the following endpoints:**


- .s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com.
