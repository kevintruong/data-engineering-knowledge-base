#### PRE-SIGNED URLS


Pre-signed URLs can be used to provide temporary access to a specific object to

those who do not have AWS credentials.


By default, all objects are private and can only be accessed by the owner.


To share an object, you can either make it public or generate a pre-signed URL.


Expiration date and time must be configured.


These can be generated using SDKs for Java and .Net and AWS explorer for Visual

Studio.


Can be used for downloading and uploading S3 objects.
