#### EVENT NOTIFICATIONS


Amazon S3 event notifications can be sent in response to actions in Amazon S3

like PUTs, POSTs, COPYs, or DELETEs.


Amazon S3 event notifications enable you to run workflows, send alerts, or

perform other actions in response to changes in your objects stored in S3.


To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that

identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where

you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications.


You can configure notifications to be filtered by the prefix and suffix of the

key name of objects.


**Amazon S3 can publish notifications for the following events:**


- New object created events

- Object removal events

- Restore object events

- Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) object lost events

- Replication events


**Amazon S3 can send event notification messages to the following

destinations:**


- Publish event messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)

  topic.

- Publish event messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

- Publish event messages to AWS Lambda by invoking a Lambda function and

  providing the event message as an argument.


Need to grant Amazon S3 permissions to post messages to an Amazon SNS topic or

an Amazon SQS queue.


Need to also grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke an AWS Lambda function on your

behalf. For information about granting these permissions.
