#### AWS CONFIG VS CLOUDTRAIL


AWS CloudTrail records user API activity on your account and allows you to

access information about this activity.


AWS Config records point-in-time configuration details for your AWS resources as

Configuration Items (CIs).


You can use an AWS Config CI to answer “What did my AWS resource look like?” at

a point in time.


You can use AWS CloudTrail to answer “Who made an API call to modify this

resource?”.
