#### CONFIG RULES


A Config Rule represents desired configurations for a resource and is evaluated

against configuration changes on the relevant resources, as recorded by AWS

Config.


AWS Config Rules can check resources for certain desired conditions and if

violations are found the


resources are flagged as “noncompliant”.


**Examples of Config Rules:**


- Is backup enabled on RDS?

- Is CloudTrail enabled on the AWS account?

- Are EBS volumes encrypted.
