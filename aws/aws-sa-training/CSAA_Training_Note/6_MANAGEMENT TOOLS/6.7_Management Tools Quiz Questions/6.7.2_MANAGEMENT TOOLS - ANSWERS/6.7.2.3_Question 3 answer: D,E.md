AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an extension of AWS CloudFormation that is

(KPIs) as custom metrics for your specific needs.

AWS Lambda is used for executing your code as functions, it is not used for packaging, testing

AWS X-Ray lets you analyze and debug serverless applications by providing distributed tracing

and service maps to easily identify performance bottlenecks by visualizing a request end-to-end.
