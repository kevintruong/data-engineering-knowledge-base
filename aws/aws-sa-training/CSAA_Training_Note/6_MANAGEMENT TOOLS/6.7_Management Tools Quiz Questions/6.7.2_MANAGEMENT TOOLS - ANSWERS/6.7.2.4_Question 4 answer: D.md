##### Question 4 answer: D


Explanation:


```

When you provision your infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CloudFormation

template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings. Because these

templates are text files, you simply track differences in your templates to track changes to your

infrastructure, similar to the way developers control revisions to source code. For example, you

can use a version control system with your templates so that you know exactly what changes

were made, who made them, and when. If at any point you need to reverse changes to your

infrastructure, you can use a previous version of your template.

AWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS. Systems

Manager provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS

services and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. However,

CloudFormation would be the preferred method of maintaining the state of the overall

architecture.

AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon

EC2 instances, on-premises instances, or serverless Lambda function.

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online resource to help you reduce cost, increase performance, and

improve security by optimizing your AWS environment, Trusted Advisor provides real time

guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.
