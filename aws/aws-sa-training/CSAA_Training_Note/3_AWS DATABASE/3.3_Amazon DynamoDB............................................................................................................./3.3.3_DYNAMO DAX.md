#### DYNAMO DAX


Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available,

in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement.


Improves performance from milliseconds to microseconds, even at millions of

requests per second.


DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your

DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data

population, or cluster management.


You do not need to modify application logic, since DAX is compatible with

existing DynamoDB API calls.


You can enable DAX with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console or using

the AWS SDK.


Just as with DynamoDB, you only pay for the capacity you provision.


Provisioned through clusters and charged by the node (runs on EC2 instances).


Pricing is per node-hour consumed and is dependent on the instance type you

select.
