#### INTEGRATIONS


ElastiCache can be used in front of DynamoDB for performance of reads on

infrequently changed data.


Triggers integrate with AWS Lambda to respond to triggers.


**Integration with RedShift:**


- RedShift complements DynamoDB with advanced business intelligence.

- When copying data from a DynamoDB table into RedShift you can perform complex

  data analysis queries including joins with other tables.

- A copy operation from a DynamoDB table counts against the tableâ€™s read

  capacity.

- After data is copied, SQL queries do not affect the data in DynamoDB.


**DynamoDB is integrated with Apache Hive on EMR. Hive can allow you to:**


- Read and write data in DynamoDB tables allowing you to query DynamoDB data

  using a SQL-like language (HiveQL).

- Copy data from a DynamoDB table to an S3 bucket and vice versa.

- Copy data from a DynamoDB table into HDFS and vice versa.

- Perform join operations on DynamoDB tables.
