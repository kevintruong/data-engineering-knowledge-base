#### CHARGES


DynamoDB charges for reading, writing, and storing data in your DynamoDB tables,

along with any optional features you choose to enable.


There are two pricing models for DynamoDB:


- **On-demand capacity mode:** DynamoDB charges you for the data reads and

  writes your application performs on your tables. You do not need to specify

  how much read and write throughput you expect your application to perform

  because DynamoDB instantly accommodates your workloads as they ramp up or

  down.

- **Provisioned capacity mode:** you specify the number of reads and writes per

  second that you expect your application to require. You can use auto scaling

  to automatically adjust your tableâ€™s capacity based on the specified

  utilization rate to ensure application performance while reducing cost.


**Additional charges include:**


- Data transfer out

- Backups per GB (continuous or on-demand)

- Global Tables

- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

- DynamoDB Streams
