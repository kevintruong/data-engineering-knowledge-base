#### CAPACITY UNITS


One read capacity unit represents one strongly consistent read per second, or

two eventually consistent reads per second for items up to 4KB.


For items larger than 4KB, DynamoDB consumes additional read capacity units.


One write capacity unit represents one write per second for an item up to 1KB.
