#### FAULT-TOLERANT AND SELF-HEALING STORAGE


Each 10GB chunk of your database volume is replicated six ways, across three

Availability Zones.


Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up

to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to

three copies without affecting read availability.


Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing; data blocks and disks are

continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.
