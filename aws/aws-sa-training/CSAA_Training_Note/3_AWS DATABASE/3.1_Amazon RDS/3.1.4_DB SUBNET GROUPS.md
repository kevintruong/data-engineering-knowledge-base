#### DB SUBNET GROUPS


A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (typically private) that you create

in a VPC and that you then designate for your DB instances.


Each DB subnet group should have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a

given region.


It is recommended to configure a subnet group with subnets in each AZ (even for

standalone instances).


During the creation of an RDS instance you can select the DB subnet group and

the AZ within the group to place the RDS DB instance in.


You cannot pick the IP within the subnet that is allocated.
