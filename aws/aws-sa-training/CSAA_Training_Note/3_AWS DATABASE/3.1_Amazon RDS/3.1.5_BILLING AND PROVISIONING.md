#### BILLING AND PROVISIONING


**AWS Charge for:**


- DB instance hours (partial hours are charged as full hours).

- Storage GB/month.

- I/O requests/month – for magnetic storage.

- Provisioned IOPS/month – for RDS provisioned IOPS SSD.

- Egress data transfer.

- Backup storage (DB backups and manual snapshots).


Backup storage for the automated RDS backup is free of charge up to the

provisioned EBS volume size.


However, AWS replicate data across multiple AZs and so you are charged for the

extra storage space on S3.


**For multi-AZ you are charged for:**


- Multi-AZ DB hours.

- Provisioned storage.

- Double write I/Os.


For multi-AZ you are not charged for DB data transfer during replication from

primary to standby.


Oracle and Microsoft SQL licences are included or you can bring your own (BYO).


On-demand and reserved instance pricing available.


**Reserved instances are defined based on the following attributes which must

not be changed:**


- DB engine.



- DB instance class

- Deployment type (standalone, multi-AZ_

- License model

- Region


**Reserved instances:**


- Can be moved between AZs in the same region.

- Are available for multi-AZ deployments.

- Can be applied to Read Replicas if DB instance class and region are the same.

- Scaling is achieved through changing the instance class for compute and

  modifying storage capacity for additional storage allocation.
