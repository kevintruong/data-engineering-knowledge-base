#### PERFORMANCE


Amazon RDS uses EBS volumes (never uses instance store) for DB and log storage.


There are three storage types available: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned

IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic.


**General Purpose (SSD):**


- Use for Database workloads with moderate I/O requirement

- Cost effective

- Also called gp2

- 3 IOPS/GB

- Burst up to 3000 IOPS


**Provisioned IOPS (SSD):**


- Use for I/O intensive workloads

- Low latency and consistent I/O

- User specified IOPS (see table below)


For provisioned IOPS storage the table below shows the range of Provisioned IOPS

and storage size range for each database engine.


**Magnetic:**


- Not recommended anymore, available for backwards compatibility.

- Doesn’t allow you to scale storage when using the SQL Server database engine.

- Doesn’t support elastic volumes.

- Limited to a maximum size of 4 TiB.

- Limited to a maximum of 1,000 IOPS.
