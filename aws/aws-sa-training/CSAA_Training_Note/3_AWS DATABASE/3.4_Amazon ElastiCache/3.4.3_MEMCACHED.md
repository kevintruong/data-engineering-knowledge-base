Ideal front-end for data stores (RDS, Dynamo DB etc.).


**Use cases:**


- Cache the contents of a DB.

- Cache data from dynamically generated web pages.

- Transient session data.

- High frequency counters for admission control in high volume web apps.


Max 100 nodes per region, 1 - 20 nodes per cluster (soft limits).


Can integrate with SNS for node failure/recovery notification.


Supports auto-discovery for nodes added/removed from the cluster.


Scales out/in (horizontally) by adding/removing nodes.


Scales up/down (vertically) by changing the node family/type.


Does not support multi-AZ failover or replication.


Does not support snapshots.


You can place nodes in different AZs.


With ElastiCache Memcached each node represents a partition of data and nodes in

a cluster can span availability zones:
