#### HIGH AVAILABILITY FOR ELASTICACHE


**Memcached:**


- Because Memcached does not support replication, a node failure will result in

  data loss.

- Use multiple nodes in each shard to minimize data loss on node failure.

- Launch multiple nodes across available AZs to minimize data loss on AZ

  failure.


**Redis:**


- Use multiple nodes in each shard and distribute the nodes across multiple AZs.

- Enable Multi-AZ on the replication group to permit automatic failover if the

  primary nodes fails.

- Schedule regular backups of your Redis cluster.
