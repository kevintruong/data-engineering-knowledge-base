#### ROUTING


The VPC router performs routing between AZs within a region.


The VPC router connects different AZs together and connects the VPC to the

Internet Gateway.


Each subnet has a route table the router uses to forward traffic within the VPC.


Route tables also have entries to external destinations.


Up to 200 route tables per VPC.


Up to 50 route entries per route table.


Each subnet can only be associated with one route table.


Can assign one route table to multiple subnets.


If no route table is specified a subnet will be assigned to the main route table

at creation time.


Cannot delete the main route table.


You can manually set another route table to become the main route table.


There is a default rule that allows all VPC subnets to communicate with one

another – this cannot be deleted or modified.


Routing between subnets is always possible because of this rule – any problems

communicating is more likely to be security groups or NACLs.
