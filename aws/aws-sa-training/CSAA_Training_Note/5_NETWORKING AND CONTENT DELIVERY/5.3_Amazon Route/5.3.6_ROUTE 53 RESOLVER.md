#### ROUTE 53 RESOLVER


Route 53 Resolver is a set of features that enable bi-directional querying

between on-premises and AWS over private connections.


Used for enabling DNS resolution for hybrid clouds.


**Route 53 Resolver Endpoints:**


- Inbound query capability is provided by Route 53 Resolver Endpoints, allowing

  DNS queries that originate on-premises to resolve AWS hosted domains.

- Connectivity needs to be established between your on-premises DNS

  infrastructure and AWS through a Direct Connect (DX)

  or a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

- Endpoints are configured through IP address assignment in each subnet for

  which you would like to provide a resolver.


**Conditional forwarding rules:**


- Outbound DNS queries are enabled through the use of Conditional Forwarding

  Rules..

- Domains hosted within your on-premises DNS infrastructure can be configured as

  forwarding rules in Route 53 Resolver.

- Rules will trigger when a query is made to one of those domains and will

  attempt to forward DNS requests to your DNS servers that were configured along

  with the rules.

- Like the inbound queries, this requires a private connection over DX or VPN.
