#### LOGGING AND MONITORING


The Amazon API Gateway logs (near real time) back-end performance metrics such

as API calls, latency, and error rates to CloudWatch.


You can monitor through the API Gateway dashboard (REST API) allowing you to

visually monitor calls to the services.


API Gateway also meters utilization by third-party developers and the data is

available in the API Gateway console and through APIs.


Amazon API Gateway is integrated with AWS CloudTrail to give a full auditable

history of the changes to your REST APIs.


All API calls made to the Amazon API Gateway APIS to create, modify, delete, or

deploy REST APIs are logged to CloudTrail.
