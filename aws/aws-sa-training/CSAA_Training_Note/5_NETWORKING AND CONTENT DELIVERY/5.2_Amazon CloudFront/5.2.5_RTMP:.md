#### RTMP:


- Distribute streaming media files using Adobe Flash Media Serverâ€™s RTMP

  protocol.

- Allows an end user to begin playing a media file before the file has finished

  downloading from a CloudFront edge location.

- Files must be stored in an S3 bucket.


To use CloudFront live streaming, create a web distribution.


**For serving both the media player and media files you need two types of

distributions:**


- A web distribution for the media player.



- An RTMP distribution for the media files.


S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs and cookie logs which log all

requests made to the S3 bucket.


Amazon Athena can be used to analyze access logs.


CloudFront is integrated with CloudTrail.


CloudTrail saves logs to the S3 bucket you specify.


CloudTrail captures information about all requests whether they were made using

the CloudFront console, the CloudFront API, the AWS SDKs, the CloudFront CLI, or

another service.


CloudTrail can be used to determine which requests were made, the source IP

address, who made the request etc.


To view CloudFront requests in CloudTrail logs you must update an existing trail

to include global services.


To delete a distribution, it must first be disabled (can take up to 15 minutes).
