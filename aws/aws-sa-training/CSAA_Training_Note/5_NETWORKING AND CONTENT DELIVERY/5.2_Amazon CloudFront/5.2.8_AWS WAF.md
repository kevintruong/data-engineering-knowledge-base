#### AWS WAF


AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor HTTP and HTTPS

requests that are forwarded to CloudFront and lets you control access to your

content.


**With AWS WAF you can shield access to content based on conditions in a web

access control list

(web ACL) such as:**


- Origin IP address.

- Values in query strings.


CloudFront responds to requests with the requested content or an HTTP 403 status

code

(forbidden).


CloudFront can also be configured to deliver a custom error page.


Need to associate the relevant distribution with the web ACL.
