#### RESTRICTIONS


Blacklists and whitelists can be used for geography â€“ you can only use one at a

time.


**There are two options available for geo-restriction (geo-blocking):**


- Use the CloudFront geo-restriction feature (use for restricting access to all

  files in a distribution and at the country level).

- Use a 3rd party geo-location service (use for restricting access to a subset

  of the files in a distribution and for finer granularity at the country level)

  .
