##### Question 5


You created a new private subnet and created a route table with a path to a NAT

gateway. However, EC2


instances launched into this subnet are not able to reach the Internet. Security

Groups for the EC2 instances are setup correctly. What is the most likely

explanation?


1. The security group for the NAT gateway is setup incorrectly.

2. You need to associate the new subnet with the new route table.

3. You need to add an entry for an Internet gateway.
