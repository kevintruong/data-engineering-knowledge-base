#### AMAZON COGNITO SYNC


Amazon Cognito Sync is an AWS service and client library that enables

cross-device syncing of application-related user data.


You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the

web without requiring your own backend.


The client libraries cache data locally so your app can read and write data

regardless of device connectivity status.


When the device is online, you can synchronize data, and if you set up push

sync, notify other devices immediately that an update is available.
