##### Question 7 answer: B,D


Explanation:


```

The aim of this solution is to create a single sign-on solution that enables users signed in to the

organization's Active Directory service to be able to connect to AWS resources. When developing

a custom identity broker you use the AWS STS service.

The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary,

limited-privilege credentials for IAM users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).

The steps performed by the custom identity broker to sign users into the AWS management

console are:

```


1. Verify that the user is authenticated by your local identity system

2. Call the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) AssumeRole or

   GetFederationToken API operations to obtain temporary security credentials

   for the user

3. Call the AWS federation endpoint and supply the temporary security

   credentials to request a sign-in token

4. Construct a URL for the console that includes the token

5. Give the URL to the user or invoke the URL on the user's behalf You cannot

   generate a pre-signed URL for this purpose using SDKs, delegate access

   through the IAM console or directly assume IAM roles.
