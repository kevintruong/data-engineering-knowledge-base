#### REAL-TIME VISIBILITY


AWS WAF provides real-time metrics and captures raw requests that include

details about IP addresses, geo locations, URIs, User-Agent and Referers.


AWS WAF is fully integrated with Amazon CloudWatch, making it easy to setup

custom alarms when thresholds are exceeded, or particular attacks occur.


This information provides valuable intelligence that can be used to create new

rules to better protect applications.
