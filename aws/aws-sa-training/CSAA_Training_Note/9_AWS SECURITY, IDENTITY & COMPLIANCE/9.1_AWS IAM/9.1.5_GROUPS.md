#### GROUPS


Groups are collections of users and have policies attached to them.


A group is not an identity and cannot be identified as a principal in an IAM

policy.


Use groups to assign permissions to users.


Use the principal of least privilege when assigning permissions.


You cannot nest groups (groups within groups).
