#### AMAZON MACHINE IMAGES


An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an

instance.


An AMI includes the following:


- A template for the root volume for the instance (for example, an operating

  system, an application server, and applications).

- Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch

  instances.

- A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance

  when it’s launched.


AMIs are regional. You can only launch an AMI from the region in which it is

stored. However, you can copy AMI’s to other regions using the console, command

line, or the API.


Volumes attached to the instance are either EBS or Instance store:


- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent storage. EBS snapshots,

  which reside on Amazon S3, are used to create the volume.

- Instance store volumes are ephemeral (non-persistent). That means data is lost

  if the instance is shut down. A template stored on Amazon S3 is used to create

  the volume.
