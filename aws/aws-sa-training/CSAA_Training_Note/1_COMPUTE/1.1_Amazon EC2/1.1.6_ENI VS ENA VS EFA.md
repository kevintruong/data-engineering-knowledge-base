#### ENI VS ENA VS EFA


**When to use ENI:**


- This is the basic adapter type for when you don't have any high performance

  requirements.

- Can use with all instance types.


**When to use ENA:**


- Good for use cases that require higher bandwidth and lower inter-instance

  latency.

- Supported for limited instance types (HVM only).


**When to use EFA:**


- High Performance Computing.

- MPI and ML use cases.

- Tightly coupled applications.

- Can use with all instance types.
