#### LAUNCH TYPES


An Amazon ECS launch type determines the type of infrastructure on which your

tasks and services are hosted.


There are two launch types and the table below describes some of the differences

between the two launch types:


```

Fargate Launch Type

```


- The Fargate launch type allows you to run your containerized applications

  without the need to provision and manage the backend infrastructure. Just

  register your task definition and Fargate launches the container for you.

- Fargate Launch Type is a serverless infrastructure managed by AWS.

- Fargate only supports container images hosted on Elastic Container Registry (

  ECR) or Docker Hub.

  **EC2 Launch Type**



- The EC2 launch type allows you to run your containerized applications on a

  cluster of Amazon EC2 instances that you manage.

- Private repositories are only supported by the EC2 Launch Type. The following

  diagram shows the two launch types and summaries some key differences:
