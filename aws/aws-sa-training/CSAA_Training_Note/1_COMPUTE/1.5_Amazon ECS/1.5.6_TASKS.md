#### TASKS


A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS.


A task definition is a text file in JSON format that describes one or more

containers, up to a maximum of 10.


Task definitions use Docker images to launch containers.


You specify the number of tasks to run (i.e. the number of containers).


**Some of the parameters you can specify in a task definition include:**


- Which Docker images to use with the containers in your task.

- How much CPU and memory to use with each container.

- Whether containers are linked together in a task.

- The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in your task.

- What (if any) ports from the container are mapped to the host container

  instances.

- Whether the task should continue if the container finished or fails.

- The commands the container should run when it is started.

- Environment variables that should be passed to the container when it starts.

- Data volumes that should be used with the containers in the task.

- IAM role the task should use for permissions.


You can use Amazon ECS Run task to run one or more tasks once.
