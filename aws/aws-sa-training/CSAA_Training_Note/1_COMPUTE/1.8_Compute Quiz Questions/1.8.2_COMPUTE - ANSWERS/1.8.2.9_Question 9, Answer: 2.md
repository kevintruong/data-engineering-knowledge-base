##### Question 9, Answer: 2


**Explanation:**


```

1 is incorrect. EBS is persistent storage and though it provides high performance it may not be

the best solution for data that is replicated or can be lost.

2 is correct. This is a good use case for Instance Store storage. It can also be cost-effective as it

comes with the price of the EC2 instance.
