##### Question 3, Answer: 4


**Explanation:**


```

1 is incorrect. Reserved instances require a commitment over 1 or 3 years.

2 is incorrect. Spot instances are good for cost-sensitive workloads that can afford to be

interrupted. This workload must complete so Spot instances would not be ideal.

3 is incorrect. Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware

that's dedicated to a single customer. This would be more expensive and there is no need for

dedicated hardware in this case.

4 is correct. On-demand instances are ideal for short-term or unpredictable workloads. You donâ€™t

get a discount, but you do have more flexibility with no commitments.
