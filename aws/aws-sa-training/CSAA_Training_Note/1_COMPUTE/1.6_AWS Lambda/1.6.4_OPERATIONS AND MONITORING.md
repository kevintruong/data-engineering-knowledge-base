#### OPERATIONS AND MONITORING


Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions and reports metrics through

CloudWatch.


Lambda tracks the number of requests, the latency per request, and the number of

requests resulting in an error.


You can view the request rates and error rates using the AWS Lambda Console, the

CloudWatch


console, and other AWS resources.


X-Ray is an AWS service that can be used to detect, analyze and optimize

performance issues with Lambda applications.


X-Ray collects metadata from the Lambda service and any upstream and downstream

services that make up your application.


Lambda is integrated with CloudTrail for capturing API calls and can deliver log

files to your S3 bucket.
