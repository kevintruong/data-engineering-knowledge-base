**Explanation:**

An Elastic Fabric Adapter is an AWS Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) with added capabilities. The EFA lets you apply the

scale, flexibility, and elasticity of the AWS Cloud to tightly-coupled HPC apps. It is ideal for tightly coupled app as

it uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI).

- ✅ :  "Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Elastic Network Interface (ENI)" is incorrect. The ENI is a basic type of adapter and is not the best  choice for this use case.

- ❌ :  "Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)" is incorrect. The ENA, which provides Enhanced Networking, does provide high  bandwidth and low inter-instance latency but it does not support the features for a tightly- coupled app that the EFA  does.

- ❌ :  "Elastic IP Address" is incorrect. An Elastic IP address is just a static public IP address, it is not a  type of network adapter.
