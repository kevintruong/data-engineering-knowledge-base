**Explanation:**

In this case AWS Lambda can perform the computation and store the data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Lambda can scale

concurrent executions to meet demand easily and DynamoDB is built for key-value data storage requirements and is also

serverless and easily scalable. This is therefore a cost effective solution for unpredictable workloads.

- ✅ :  "AWS Lambda" is a correct answer.

- ✅ :  "Amazon DynamoDB" is also a correct answer.

- ❌ :  "AWS Fargate" is incorrect as containers run constantly and therefore incur costs even when no requests are

  being made.

- ❌ :  "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling" is incorrect as this uses EC2 instances which will incur costs even when no

  requests are being made.

- ❌ :  "Amazon RDS" is incorrect as this is a relational database not a No-SQL database. It is therefore not

  suitable for key-value data storage requirements.
