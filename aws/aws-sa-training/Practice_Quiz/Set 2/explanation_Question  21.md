**Explanation:**

Amazon CloudFront can be used to stream video to users across the globe using a wide variety of protocols that are

layered on top of HTTP. This can include both on-demand video as well as real time streaming video.

- ✅ :  "Amazon CloudFront" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "AWS Global Accelerator" is incorrect as this would be an expensive way of getting the content closer to

  users compared to using CloudFront. As this is a use case for CloudFront and there are so many edge locations it is

  the better option.

- ❌ :  "Amazon Route 53" is incorrect as you still need a solution for getting the content closer to users.

- ❌ :  "Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration" is incorrect as this is used to accelerate uploads of data to Amazon S3

  buckets.
