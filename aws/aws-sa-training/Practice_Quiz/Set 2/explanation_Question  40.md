**Explanation:**

Amazon API Gateway decouples the client application from the back-end application-layer services by providing a single

endpoint for API requests.

The architecture of API Gateway is depicted in the diagram below:

- ✅ :  "Amazon API Gateway" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "AWS Device Farm" is incorrect. AWS Device farm is an app testing service for Android, iOS and web apps.

- ❌ :  "Amazon Cognito" is incorrect. Amazon Cognito is used for adding sign-up, sign-in and access control to

  mobile apps.

- ❌ :  "Application Load Balancer" is incorrect. An application load balancer distributes incoming connection

  requests to back-end EC2 instances. It is not used for decoupling application-layer services from mobile clients.
