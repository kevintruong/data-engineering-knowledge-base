**Explanation:**

This scenario asks that when retrieving data the chosen storage solution should always return the most up-to- date data.

Therefore we must use Amazon RDS as it provides read-after-write consistency.

- ✅ :  "Amazon RDS" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Amazon RedShift" is incorrect. Amazon RedShift is a data warehouse and is not used as a transactional

  database so this is the wrong use case for it.

- ❌ :  "Amazon S3" is incorrect. Amazon S3 only provides eventual consistency for overwrites and deletes.

- ❌ :  "AWS Storage Gateway" is incorrect. AWS Storage Gateway is used for enabling hybrid cloud access to AWS

  storage services from on-premises.
