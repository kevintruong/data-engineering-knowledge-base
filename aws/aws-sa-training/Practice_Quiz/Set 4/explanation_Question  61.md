**Explanation:**

Policies are documents that define permissions and can be applied to users, groups and roles. Policy documents are

written in JSON (key value pair that consists of an attribute and a value).

Within an IAM policy you can grant either programmatic access or AWS Management Console access to Amazon S3 resources.

* ✅ :  "Grant programmatic access" is a correct answer.

* ✅ :  "Create an IAM policy" is also a correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Create a bucket policy" is incorrect as it is more efficient to use an IAM policy.

* ❌ :  "Use key pairs" is incorrect. Key pairs are used for access to EC2 instances; a bucket policy would not

  assist with access control with EC2 and granting management console access will not assist the application which is

  making API calls to the services.

* ❌ :  "Grant AWS Management Console access" is incorrect as programmatic access is required.
