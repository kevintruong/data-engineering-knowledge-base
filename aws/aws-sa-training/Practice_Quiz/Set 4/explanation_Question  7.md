**Explanation:**

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message

brokers in the cloud. Connecting current applications to Amazon MQ is easy because it uses industry-standard APIs and

protocols for messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket. Using standards means that in most cases,

there’s no need to rewrite any messaging code when you migrate to AWS.

- ✅ :  "Amazon MQ" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Amazon SQS" is incorrect. This is an Amazon proprietary service and does not support industry- standard

  messaging APIs and protocols.

- ❌ :  "Amazon SNS" is incorrect. This is a notification service not a message bus.

- ❌ :  "AWS Step Functions" is incorrect. This is a workflow orchestration service, not a message bus.
