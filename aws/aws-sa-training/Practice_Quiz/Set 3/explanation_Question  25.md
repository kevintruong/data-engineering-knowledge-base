**Explanation:**

The best solution is to use a combination of scripts and AWS CloudFormation. You will also leverage the AWS

Organizations API. This solution can provide all of the requirements.

- ✅ :  "Use CloudFormation with scripts" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Use the AWS Organizations API" is incorrect. You can create member accounts with the AWS Organizations API.

  However, you cannot use that API to configure the account and create VPCs and subnets.

- ❌ :  "Use the AWS Management Console" is incorrect. Using the AWS Management Console is not a method of

  automatically creating the resources.

- ❌ :  "Use the AWS CLI" is incorrect. You can do all tasks using the AWS CLI but it is better to automate the

  process using AWS CloudFormation.
