**Explanation:**

The possible values are ok, impaired, warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the

volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks

may still be taking place on your volume at the time.

- ✅ :  "The checks may still be in progress on the volume" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "The checks have failed on the volume" is incorrect. The checks have not failed or the status would be

  impaired.

- ❌ :  "The volume does not have enough data on it to check properly" is incorrect. The volume does not need a

  certain amount of data on it to be checked properly.

- ❌ :  "The checks require more information to be manually entered" is incorrect. The checks do not require manual

  input.
