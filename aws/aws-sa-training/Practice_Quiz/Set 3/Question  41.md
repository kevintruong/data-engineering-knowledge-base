#### Question  41

**A Kinesis consumer application is reading at a slower rate than expected. It has been identified that multiple

consumer applications have total reads exceeding the per-shard limits. How can this situation be resolved?**

- [x] :  Increase the number of shards in the Kinesis data stream

- [ ] :  Implement API throttling to restrict the number of requests per-shard

- [ ] :  Increase the number of read transactions per shard

- [ ] :  Implement read throttling for the Kinesis data stream
