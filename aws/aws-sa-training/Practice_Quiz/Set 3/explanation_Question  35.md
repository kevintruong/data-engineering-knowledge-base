**Explanation:**

An Interface endpoint uses AWS PrivateLink and is an elastic network interface (ENI) with a private IP address that

serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service.

Using PrivateLink you can connect your VPC to supported AWS services, services hosted by other AWS accounts (VPC

endpoint services), and supported AWS Marketplace partner services.

- ✅ :  "VPC Endpoint Services using AWS PrivateLink" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "IAM Role Based Access Control" is incorrect as this provides authorization.

- ❌ :  "Route 53" is incorrect as this service provides DNS resolution.

- ❌ :  "API Gateway" is incorrect as this service is used for hosting REST and Websocket APIs.
