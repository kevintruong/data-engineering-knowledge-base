**Explanation:**

A VPG is used to setup an AWS VPN which you can use in combination with Direct Connect to encrypt all data that

traverses the Direct Connect link. This combination provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection that also reduces

network costs, increases bandwidth throughput, and provides a more consistent network experience than internet-based VPN

connections.

- ✅ :  "Setup a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG)" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Enable IPSec encryption on the Direct Connect connection" is incorrect. There is no option to enable IPSec

  encryption on the Direct Connect connection.

- ❌ :  "Setup the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) with encryption" is incorrect. The BGP protocol is not used to

  enable encryption for Direct Connect, it is used for routing.

- ❌ :  "Configure an AWS Direct Connect Gateway" is incorrect. An AWS Direct Connect Gateway is used to connect to

  VPCs across multiple AWS regions. It is not involved with encryption.
