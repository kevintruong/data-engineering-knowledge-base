data directly from your datacenter, office, or colocation environment into and from AWS, bypassing your Internet service

provider and removing network congestion.

  into a virtual network that you’ve defined.

* ❌ :  "IPSec VPN" is incorrect. An IPSec VPN can be used to connect to AWS however it does not bypass the ISPs or

  Internet.

  System (DNS) web service.
