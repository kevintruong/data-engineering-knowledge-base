**Explanation:**

A virtual private gateway is a logical, fully redundant distributed edge routing function that sits at the edge of your

VPC. You must create a VPG in your VPC before you can establish an AWS Managed site-to-site VPN connection. The other

end of the connection is the customer gateway which must be established on the customer side of the connection.

- ✅ :  "Configure a Virtual Private Gateway" is the correct answer.

- ❌ :  "Setup an AWS Direct Connect connection" is incorrect as this would take too long to provision.

- ❌ :  "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution" is incorrect. This is not a solution for enabling connectivity

  using private addresses to an on-premises site. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN).

- ❌ :  "Create an AWS Transit Gateway" is incorrect. AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on- premises networks

  through a central hub which is not a requirement of this solution.
