**Explanation:**

AWS Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions and reports metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. Lambda tracks the

number of requests, the latency per request, and the number of requests resulting in an error. You can view the request

rates and error rates using the AWS Lambda Console, the CloudWatch console, and other AWS resources.

* ✅ :  "Total number of requests" is a correct answer.

* ✅ :  "Latency per request" is also a correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Number of users" is incorrect as this is not returned.

* ❌ :  "Total number of connections" is incorrect as this is not returned.

* ❌ :  "Total number of transactions" is incorrect as this is not returned.
