**Explanation:**

Trails can be configured to log Data events and management events:

**Data events:** These events provide insight into the resource operations performed on or within a resource. These are

also known as data plane operations

**Management events:** Management events provide insight into management operations that are performed on resources in

your AWS account. These are also known as control plane operations. Management events can also include non-API events

that occur in your account
