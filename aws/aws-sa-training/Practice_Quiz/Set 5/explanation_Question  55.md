**Explanation:**

Note that the questions asks you which transport protocols are supported, NOT which subscribers – therefore AWS Lambda

is not supported.

Amazon SNS supports notifications over multiple transport protocols:

* HTTP/HTTPS – subscribers specify a URL as part of the subscription registration.

* Email/Email-JSON – messages are sent to registered addresses as email (text-based or JSON-object).

* SQS – users can specify an SQS standard queue as the endpoint.

* SMS – messages are sent to registered phone numbers as SMS text messages.

* ✅ :  "HTTPS" is the correct answer.

* ✅ :  "Email-JSON" is the correct answer.

* ❌ :  "Amazon SWF" is incorrect as this is not a supported transport protocol.

* ❌ :  "FTP" is incorrect as this is not a supported transport protocol.

* ❌ :  "AWS Lambda" is incorrect as this is not a supported transport protocol.
